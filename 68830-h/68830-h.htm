</div>


<p>The present book is the outcome of a course of eight lectures
delivered before the Lowell Institute of Boston in the
early part of 1907.</p>

<p>In this presentation of the subject the attempt has been
made to give a systematic account of our knowledge regarding
some of the more important processes of nutrition, with
special reference to the needs of the body for food. In doing
this, the facts accumulated by painstaking observations and
experiments during recent years in our laboratory have been
incorporated with data from other sources and brought into
harmony, so far as possible, with the modern trend of physiological
thought.</p>

<p>Numerous experimental results, hitherto unpublished, have
been introduced, notably in Chapter VII, in which a few of
the data recently obtained in our laboratory with dogs are
presented in some detail, since they afford evidence of the
error of the current arguments concerning the necessity of a
high proteid intake by man, as based on the results of earlier
investigators with high proteid animals.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the facts and arguments here presented
will help to arouse a more general interest in the subject of
human nutrition, as right methods of living promise so much
for the health and happiness of the individual and of the
community.</p>

<p>One of the great mysteries of life is the power of growth,
that harmonious development of composite organs and
tissues from simple protoplasmic cells, with the ultimate
formation of a complex organism with its orderly adjustment
of structure and function. Equally mysterious is that wonderful
power of rehabilitation by which the cells of the body
are able to renew their living substance and to maintain
their ceaseless activity through a period, it may be of fourscore
years, before succumbing to the inevitable fate that
awaits all organic structures. This bodily activity, visible
and invisible, is the result of a third mysterious process,
more or less continuous as long as life endures, of chemical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
disintegration, decomposition, and oxidation, by which arises
the evolution of energy to maintain the heat of the body and
the power for mental and physical work.</p>

<p>These three main functions constitute the purpose of nutrition.
The growth of the adult man from the tiny cell or
germ that marks his simple beginning is at the expense of
the food material he absorbs and assimilates. The rehabilitation
of the cells, or the composite tissues of the fully developed
organism, is accomplished through utilization of the
daily food, whereby cell substance is renewed and all losses
made good. The energy which manifests itself in the form
of heat and mechanical or mental work, <i>i. e.</i>, the energy by
which the vital machinery is maintained in ceaseless activity,
comes from the breaking down of the food materials by means
of which, as the saying goes, the body is nourished. The
body thus becomes the centre of different lines of activity,
the food serving as the material out of which new cells and
tissues are constructed, old cells revivified, and energy for
running the bodily machinery derived. Development, growth,
and vital activity all depend upon the availability of food
in proper amounts and proper quality.</p>

<p>The food of man is composed mainly of organic materials,
for while, as Dr. <span class="nowrap">Curtis<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> has expressed it, “the plant can
make organic matter out of inorganic elements, just this the
animal cannot do at all. The thing of legs and locomotion,
of spine and speech, can build his organic walls only out of
organic bricks ruthlessly ripped from existing walls of other
animals or plants.” It is true that man has need of certain
inorganic salts in his daily diet, but they are in the nature
of aids to nutrition (aside from such as are necessary for the
formation of bone and teeth), contributing in some measure
toward regulation and control of nutritive processes rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
than as a source of energy to the body. Inorganic substances,
however, are an integral part of the essential tissues and
organs of the body, being combined with the organic constituents
of the living cells. Indeed, electrolytes are perhaps
the substances that put life into the proteids of the protoplasm,
and it is truly important for the integrity and functional
power of living cells that the proportion of inorganic constituents
therein be kept in a constant condition of quality
and quantity. Still, the food of mankind is essentially organic
in nature, and while it may be exceedingly varied in
character, ranging from the simple vegetable dietary of the
natives of India and the Far East to the voluminous admixture
of varied forms of animal and vegetable foodstuffs so
acceptable to the <i>bon vivant</i> of our western civilization, the
principles contained therein are few in number.</p>

<p>The organic foodstuffs are of three distinct types and are
classified under three heads, viz.: Proteids or Albuminous
foodstuffs, Carbohydrates, and Fats. All animal and vegetable
foods, whatever their nature and whatever their origin,
are composed simply of representatives of one or more of
these three classes of food principles.</p>

<p>Proteid substances are characterized by containing about
16 per cent of nitrogen. In addition, they contain on an
average 52 per cent of carbon, 7 per cent of hydrogen, 23
per cent of oxygen, and 0.5–2.0 per cent of sulphur. A
certain class of proteids, known as nucleoproteids because
of their occurrence in the nuclei of cells, contain likewise a
small amount of phosphorus in organic combination. Proteid
or albuminous substances constitute the chemical basis
of all living cells, whether animal or vegetable. This means,
expressed in different language, that the organic substance
of all organs and tissues, whether of animals or plants, is
made up principally of proteid matter. Proteid substances
occupy, therefore, a peculiar position in the nutrition of man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
and of animals in general. They constitute the class of essential
foodstuffs without which life is impossible. For tissue-building
and for the renewal of tissues and organs, or their
component cells, proteid or albuminous foodstuffs are an
absolute requirement. The vital part of all tissue is proteid,
and only proteid food can serve for its growth or renewal.
Hence, no matter how generous the supply of carbohydrates
and fats, without some admixture of proteid food the body
will weaken and undergo “nitrogen starvation.” It is to be
noted, however, that while the element nitrogen (16 per
cent) gives character to the proteid or albuminous foodstuffs,
so that they are frequently spoken of or classified as the
“nitrogenous foodstuffs,” it is not the nitrogen <i>per se</i> that is
so essential for the nutrition of the body. Man lives in an atmosphere
of oxygen and nitrogen. He can and does absorb
and utilize the free oxygen of the air he breathes; indeed, it
is absolutely essential for his existence, but the free nitrogen
likewise drawn into the lungs at each inspiration is of no
avail for the needs of the body. Further, there are many
compounds of nitrogen, some of them closely allied to the
proteid foodstuffs in chemical composition, which are just
as useless as free nitrogen in meeting the wants of the body
for nitrogenous foods.</p>

<p>Dame Nature is very discriminating; she demands a definite
form of nitrogenous compound, some peculiar or specific
grouping of the nitrogen element with other elements in the
food that can make good the waste of proteid tissue. In the
inactive and fibrous tissues of animals, such as are found in
bones, tendons, and ligaments, there is present a substance
known as collagen, which, when boiled with water, as in the
making of soups, is transformed into gelatin. This body,
because of its close chemical relationship to proteid or albuminous
substances, is known as an albuminoid. Yet, though
it has essentially the same chemical composition as ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
albuminous substances and shows many of the reactions characteristic
of the latter, it cannot take the place of true proteid
in building up or repairing the tissues of the body. To
quote again from Dr. Curtis: “Tissue is nitrogenous, so
that, of course, only nitrogenous food can serve for its making;
but of the two kinds of nitrogenous principles, proteids
and albuminoids, behold, proteids only are of avail! Why
this is so is unknown, since albuminoid is equally nitrogenous
with proteid; but so it is&mdash;proteid and proteid alone
can fulfil the high function of furnishing the material basis
of life. Gelatin cannot even go to make the very kind of
tissue of which itself is a derivative. Alongside of its
brother proteid, gelatin stands as a prince of the blood whose
escutcheon bears the ‘bend sinister.’ Such a one, though of
royal lineage, may never aspire to the throne.” It is thus
quite clear that the true proteid foods are tissue builders in
the broadest sense of the term, and it is equally evident that
they are absolutely essential for life, since no other kind or
form of foodstuff can take their place in supplying the needs
of the body. Every living cell, whether of heart, muscle,
brain, or nerve, requires its due allowance of proteid material
to maintain its physiological rhythm. No other foodstuff
stands in such intimate relationship to the vital processes,
but so far as we know at present any form of true proteid,
whether animal or vegetable, will serve the purpose.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates include two closely related classes of compounds,
viz., sugars and starches. They are entirely free
from nitrogen, containing only carbon (44.4 per cent), hydrogen
(6.2 per cent), and oxygen (49.4 per cent), and hence are
classified as non-nitrogenous foods. Obviously, they cannot
serve as tissue builders, but by oxidation they yield energy
for heat and work. They constitute an easily oxidizable
form of fuel, and when supplied in undue amounts they
may undergo transformation within the body into fat, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
is temporarily deposited in tissues and organs for future
needs.</p>

<p>Fats, like carbohydrates, are free from nitrogen, but differ
from them in containing a much larger percentage of carbon,
and hence have greater fuel value per pound. Fats contain
on an average 76.5 per cent of carbon, 11.9 per cent of
hydrogen, and 11.5 per cent of oxygen. With their larger
content of carbon and smaller proportion of oxygen, fats are
less easily oxidizable than sugars, requiring a larger intake
of oxygen for their combustion, but when oxidized they yield
more heat per pound than carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Fats and carbohydrates are thus seen to be the natural fuel
foodstuffs of the body. They cannot serve for the upbuilding
or renewal of tissue, but by oxidation they constitute an
economical fuel for maintaining body temperature and for
power to run the bodily machinery. It should be remembered,
however, that anything capable of being burned in
the body may serve as fuel material; hence proteid food,
though of specific value as a tissue builder, may likewise by
its oxidation yield energy for heat and work, but its combustion,
owing to the content of nitrogen, is never complete.
Further, its use as fuel is uneconomical and undesirable for
reasons to be discussed later, but it is well to know that its
oxidation, though incomplete, is accompanied by the liberation
of energy, as in the oxidation of non-nitrogenous foods.
A portion of the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen of the proteid
molecule will burn within the body to gaseous products, as
do sugars and fats, but there remains a nucleus of nitrogen,
with some carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, which resists combustion
and must be gotten rid of by the combined labors of
liver and kidneys. Fats and carbohydrates, on the other
hand, undergo complete combustion to simple gaseous products,
carbon dioxide and water, which are easily removed by
the lungs, skin, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>These three classes of foodstuffs exist in a great variety
of combinations or admixtures in nature. In many cases,
noticeably in milk, all three occur together in fairly large
quantities. In animal foods, such as meats, fish, etc., proteid
and fat alone are found, while in perfectly lean meat
proteid only is present, excepting a small amount of fat.
Again, the white of the egg contains proteid alone. Hence,
a meat and egg diet would be essentially a proteid diet. In
vegetable foods, as in the cereals, there is found an admixture
of proteid and starch, the latter predominating in many
cases, as in wheat flour. The following table<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> showing the
chemical composition of various food materials, may be of
service in throwing light on the relative distribution of the
three classes of foodstuffs in natural products.</p>

<p>In commenting on these figures, reference to which will be
made from time to time in other connections, it may be wise
to emphasize the large amount of water almost invariably
present in natural foodstuffs. Further, it is to be noted that,
in animal products especially, the variations in proteid-content
are in large measure coincident with variations in the amount
of water present. In other words, foods of animal origin if
freed entirely of water would, as a rule, show essentially the
same percentage of proteid matter. Fat is naturally variable,
according to the condition of the animal at the time it was
slaughtered. Among the vegetable products, carbohydrate,
mainly in the form of starch, becomes exceedingly conspicuous,
though proteid is by no means lacking. Indeed,
in some cereals, as in oatmeal, in dried peas and beans, the
content of proteid will average as high as in fresh beef, while
in addition 50–70 per cent of the entire substance is made up
of carbohydrate. Again, in the edible nuts, the content of
proteid runs high, in some cases higher than in fresh beef,
while at the same time carbohydrate and fat are noticeably
large. Further, it is to be noted that in nuts there is here
and there some striking individuality, as in pine nuts and
Brazil nuts, both of which show a noticeable lack of carbohydrate
as contrasted with peanuts, almonds, and walnuts;
a fact of some importance in cases where a vegetable food
rich in proteid is desired, but with freedom from starch.</p>

<p>Another generality, to be thoroughly understood, is that
while the figures given for proteid express quite clearly and
with reasonable degree of accuracy the relative amounts of
proteid matter present in the foodstuffs in question, there
may be important differences in availability of which the
percentage figures give no suggestion. In other words, the
analytical data deal solely with the total content of proteid,
while there is needed in addition information as to the relative
digestibility, or availability by the body, of the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
kinds of proteid food. For example, roast mutton, cream
cheese, and dried peas contain approximately the same
amount of proteid. Are we then to infer that these three
foods have the same nutritive value so far as proteid is concerned?
Surely not, since no account is taken of the relative
digestibility of the three foods. It is one of the axioms
of physiology that the true nutritive value of any proteid
food is dependent not alone upon the amount of proteid contained
therein, but upon the quantity of proteid that can be
digested and absorbed; or, in other words, made available for
the needs of the body. The same rule holds good for both
fats and carbohydrates, but as proteid is the more important
foodstuff, and is as a rule taken more sparingly, the
question of availability has greater import with the proteid
foods.</p>

<p>The availability or digestibility of foods can be determined
only by physiological experiment. By making a comparison
for a definite period of time of the amount of a given food ingredient
consumed and the amount that passes unchanged
through the intestine, an estimate of its digestibility can be
made. The result, to be sure, is not wholly free from error,
since we cannot always distinguish between the undigested
food and so-called metabolic products coming from the digestive
juices and from the walls of the intestine; but the errors
are not large, and results so obtained are full of meaning.
In a general way it may be stated that with animal foods,
such as meats, eggs, and milk, about 97 per cent of the contained
proteid is digested and thereby rendered available for
the body. With ordinary vegetable foods, on the other hand,
as they are usually prepared for consumption, only about
85 per cent of the proteid is made available. This is partially
due to the presence in the vegetable tissue of cellulose,
which in some measure prevents that thorough attack of the
proteid by the digestive juices which occurs with animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
foods. With a mixed diet, <i>i. e.</i>, with a variable admixture
of animal and vegetable foods, it is usually considered that
about 92 per cent of the proteid contained therein will undergo
digestion.</p>

<p>Regarding differences in the availability of fats, it may be
stated that, as a rule, the fatty matter contained in vegetable
foods is less readily, or less thoroughly, digested than that
present in foods of animal origin. In the latter, about 95
per cent of the fat is digested and absorbed. This figure,
however, is generally taken as representing approximately the
digestibility or availability of the fat contained in man’s daily
dietary, since by far the larger proportion of the fat consumed
is of animal origin. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are
much more easily utilized by the body. Naturally, sugars,
owing to their great solubility and ready diffusibility, offer
little difficulty in the way of easy digestion; but starches
likewise, though not so readily assimilable, are digested, as
a rule, to the extent of 98 per cent or more of the amount
consumed. It is thus evident that in any estimate of the
food value of a given diet, chemical composition is to
be checked by the digestibility or availability of the food
ingredients.</p>

<p>As has been stated several times, the proteid foodstuffs
are the more important, since proteid matter is essential to
animal life. Man must have a certain amount of proteid
food to maintain the body in a condition of strength and
vigor. The other essential is that the daily food furnish
sufficient energy to meet the needs of the body for heat and
power. This means that in addition to proteid, which primarily
serves a particular purpose, there must be enough
non-nitrogenous food (either carbohydrate or fat or both) to
provide the requisite fuel for oxidation or combustion to
meet the demands of the body for heat and for work; both
of which are subject to great variation owing to differences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
in the temperature of the surrounding air, and especially because
of variations in the degree of bodily activity. The
energy which a given foodstuff will yield can be ascertained
by laboratory experiment, in which a definite weight of the
substance is burned or oxidized in a calorimetric bomb under
conditions where the exact amount of heat liberated can be
accurately measured. The fuel, or energy, value so obtained
is expressed in calories or heat units. A calorie may be defined
as the amount of heat required to raise 1 gram of water
1°&nbsp;C., or, to be more exact, the amount of heat required to
raise 1 gram of water from 15° to 16°&nbsp;C. This unit is
usually spoken of as the small calorie, to distinguish it
from the large calorie, which represents the amount of heat
required to raise 1 kilogram of water 1°&nbsp;C. Hence, the
large calorie is equal to one thousand small calories. When
burned in a calorimeter, 1 gram of carbohydrate yields on
an average 4100 gram-degree units of heat, or small calories;
1 gram of fat yields 9300 small calories. Both of these non-nitrogenous
foods burn or oxidize to the same products&mdash;viz.,
carbon dioxide and water&mdash;when utilized in the body
as when burned in the calorimeter; hence, the figures given
represent the physiological heat of combustion, per gram, of
the two classes of foodstuffs. Obviously, the fuel values of
different foods belonging to the same group or class will
show slight variation, but the above figures represent average
values.</p>

<p>Unlike fats and carbohydrates, proteids are not burned
completely in the body; hence, the physiological fuel value
of a proteid is less than the value obtained by oxidation in
a bomb calorimeter. In the body, proteids yield certain decomposition
products which are removed through the excreta,
and which represent a certain quantity of potential energy
thus lost to the economy. The average fuel value of proteids
burned outside of the body is placed at 5711 calories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
per gram<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> or 5.7 large calories. Deducting the heat value
of the proteid decomposition products contained in the excreta,
the physiological fuel value of proteids is reduced on
an average to about 4.1 large calories per gram<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> Rubner
considers that the physiological fuel value of vegetable proteids
is somewhat less than that of animal proteids; conglutin,
for example, yielding 3.96 calories, as contrasted
with 4.3 calories furnished by egg-albumin, or 4.40 calories
from casein. On a mixed diet, where 60 per cent of the
ingested proteid food is of animal origin and 40 per cent
vegetable, the fuel value available to the body would be
about 4.1 calories per gram of proteid, on the assumption
that the physiological heat value of vegetable proteids averages
3.96 calories per gram and that of animal proteids 4.23
calories per gram (Rubner).</p>

<p>At present, we accept for all purposes of computation the
following figures as representing the physiological or available
(to the body) fuel value of the three classes of organic
foodstuffs:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="" summary="fuel value of main foodstuffs">

</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>From these data, it is evident at a glance that 1 gram of
fat is isodynamic with 2.27 grams of either carbohydrate or
proteid; and since carbohydrate and fat are of use to the
body mainly because of their energy value, it is obvious that
50 grams of fat taken as food will be of as much service to
the body as 113 grams of starch. In view of the relatively
high fuel value of fats, it follows that the physiological heat
of combustion of any given food material will correspond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
largely with the content of fat therein. This is quite
apparent from the data given in the table showing chemical
composition of food materials, where the fuel value per pound
is seen to run more or less closely parallel with the percentage
of fat. Experience, as well as direct physiological
experiment, teaches us, however, that fat and carbohydrate
cannot be interchanged indefinitely, because of the difficulty
in utilization of fat when the amount is increased beyond a
certain point. Personal experience provides ample evidence
of the difference in availability between the two classes of
foodstuffs. Carbohydrates are easily utilizable, fats with
more difficulty. Palate, as well as stomach, rebels at large
quantities of fat; a statement that certainly holds good for
most civilized people, though exceptions may be found, as in
the Esquimeaux and certain savage races.</p>

<p>In the nourishment of the body, the various factors that aid
in the utilization of food are of great moment and must not
be overlooked. It is not enough that the body be supplied
with the proper proportion of nutrients, with sufficient proteid
to meet the demand for nitrogen, and with carbohydrate
and fat adequate to yield the needed energy; but all those
physiological processes which have to do with the preparation
of the foodstuffs for absorption into the circulating blood
and lymph must be in effective working order. There is an
intricacy of detail here which calls for careful oversight, and
it is one of the functions of the nervous system to control
and regulate both the mechanical and the chemical processes
that are concerned in this seemingly automatic progression
of foodstuffs from their entry into the mouth cavity to their
final discharge from the alimentary tract, after removal of
the last vestige of true nutritive material.</p>

<p>Mastication; deglutition; secretion of the various digestive
juices, saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic juice, bile, intestinal
juice, etc.; peristalsis, or the rhythmical movements of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
muscular walls of the gastro-intestinal tract; the solvent
action of the several digestive fluids on the different types
of foodstuffs; the absorption of the products formed as a
preliminary step in their transportation to the tissues and
organs of the body, where they are to serve their ultimate purpose
in nutrition; the interaction of these several processes
one on the other; and, finally, the influence of the various
nerve fibres and nerve centres concerned in the control of
these varied activities,&mdash;all must work together in harmony
and precision if the full measure of available nitrogen and
energy-yielding material is to be extracted and absorbed
from the ingested food, without undue expenditure of physiological
labor. Further, the various processes of cell and
tissue metabolism, by which the absorbed food material is
built up into living protoplasm, and the chemical processes
of oxidation, hydrolysis, reduction, etc., by which the intra
and extra cellular material is broken down progressively into
varied katabolic or excretory products, with liberation of
energy; all these must move forward harmoniously and with
due regard to the preservation of an even balance between
intake and outgo, if the nutrition of the body is to be maintained
at a proper level, and with that degree of physiological
economy which is coincident with good health and high
efficiency.</p>

<p>We may well pause here and consider briefly some of these
processes which play so prominent a part in the proper utilization
of the three classes of organic foodstuffs. The first
digestive fluid which the ingested food comes in contact
with is the saliva. Sensory nerve fibres, chiefly of the
glossopharyngeal and lingual nerves which supply the mouth
and tongue, are stimulated by the sapid substances of the
food, and likewise by mere contact of the food particles with
the mucous membrane lining the mouth cavity as the food is
masticated and rolled about prior to deglutition. Impulses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
communicated in this way to the above sensory nerves are
transmitted to certain nerve centres in the medulla oblongata,
whence impulses are reflected back through secretory nerves
going to the individual salivary glands, thereby calling forth
a secretion. The production of saliva is thus a simple reflex
act, in which the food consumed serves as a true stimulant
or excitant. Pawlow<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> indeed, claims a certain degree of
adaptability of the secretion to the character of the food
taken into the mouth. Thus, he finds that dry, solid food
excites a large flow of saliva, such as would be needed to
masticate it properly and bring it into a suitable condition
for swallowing. On the other hand, foods containing an
abundance of water cause only a scanty flow of saliva. The
situation of this secretory centre in the medulla, and the many
branchings of nerve cells in this locality would naturally
suggest the possibility of salivary secretion being incited by
stimuli from a variety of sources. This is indeed the case,
and it is worthy of note that a flow of saliva may result from
stimulation of the sensory fibres of the vagus nerves as well
as of the splanchnic and sciatic, thus indicating how a given
secreting gland may be called into activity by impulses or
stimuli which come to the centre through very indirect and
devious pathways. Further, the secretory centre may be
stimulated, and likewise inhibited, by impulses which have
their origin in higher nerve centres in the brain. These
facts are of great importance in throwing light upon the
ways in which a secretion like saliva is called forth and its
digestive action thus made possible. The thought and the
odor of savory food cause the mouth to water, the flow of
saliva so incited being the result of psychical stimulation.
Similarly, fear, embarrassment, and anxiety frequently cause
a dry mouth and parched throat through inhibition of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
secretory centre by impulses which have their origin in higher
centres in the brain.</p>

<p>The application of these facts to our subject is perfectly
obvious, since they suggest at once how the production or
secretion of an important digestive fluid&mdash;upon which the
utilization of a given class of foodstuffs may be quite dependent&mdash;is
controlled and modified through the nervous
system by a variety of circumstances. We might reason
that the appearance, odor, and palatability of food are factors
of prime importance in its utilization by the body; that the
æsthetics of eating are not to be ignored, since they have an
important influence upon the flow of the digestive secretions.
A peaceful mind, pleasurable anticipation, freedom from
care and anxiety, cheerful companionship, all form desirable
table accessories which play the part of true psychical stimuli
in accelerating the flow of the digestive juices and thus pave
the way for easy and thorough digestion. Further, it is
easy to see how thorough mastication of food may prolong
mechanical stimulation of the salivary glands and thus increase
the flow of the secretion, while the longer stay of
sapid substances in the mouth cavity increases the duration
of the chemical stimulation of the sensory fibres of the lingual
and glossopharyngeal nerves. In this connection, we may cite
the view recently advanced by Pawlow that the individual
salivary glands respond normally to different stimuli. Thus,
there are three pairs of salivary glands concerned in the production
of saliva,&mdash;the submaxillary, parotid, and sublingual,&mdash;all
of which pour their secretions through separate ducts
into the mouth cavity. By experiment, Pawlow has found
that in the dog the submaxillary gland yields a copious flow
of saliva when stimulated by acids, the chewing of meats,
the sight of food, etc., while the parotid gland fails to respond.
On the other hand, the latter gland responds with an abundant
secretion when dry food, such as dry powdered meat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
dried bread, etc., is placed in the mouth. With this gland,
the inference is that dryness is the active stimulus.</p>

<p>As a digestive secretion, saliva serves several important
purposes. By moistening the food it renders mastication and
deglutition possible; its natural alkalinity tends to neutralize
somewhat such acidity as may be present in the food;
it dissolves various solid substances, thus making a solution
capable of stimulating the taste nerves; lastly, and most
important, it has a marked digestive and solvent action on
starchy foods. A large proportion of the non-nitrogenous
food consumed by man&mdash;in most countries&mdash;is composed of
some form of starch, and this the body cannot use until it
has undergone conversion into soluble forms, such as dextrins
and sugar. This it is the function of saliva to accomplish,
and it owes its activity in this direction to the presence
of a soluble ferment or enzyme known as ptyalin.</p>

<p>Enzymes, which play so important a part in all digestive
processes, are a peculiar class of substances produced by the
living cells which constitute the various secreting glands.
They are of unknown composition, and are peculiar in that
the chemical changes they induce are the result of what is
termed catalysis, <i>i. e.</i>, contact. That is, the enzyme or catalyzer
does not enter into the reaction, it is not destroyed
or used up, but by its mere presence sets in motion or
accelerates a reaction between two other substances. The
ordinary illustration from the inorganic world is spongy
platinum, which, if placed in contact with a mixture of
oxygen and hydrogen, causes the two gases to unite with
formation of water, although the two gases alone at ordinary
temperature will not so combine. In this reaction the
platinum is not altered, neither does it apparently enter into
the reaction; it is a simple catalyzer. The chemical nature of
the change which most digestive enzymes produce is usually
defined as hydrolytic, in which the substance undergoing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
transformation is made to combine with water, thus becoming
hydrolyzed, this reaction generally being accompanied by a
cleavage or splitting of the molecule into simpler substances.
It is to be noted further that enzymes are specific in their
action. An enzyme that acts upon starch, for example, cannot
act on proteids or fats. Some digestive fluids have the
power of producing changes in different classes of foodstuffs,
but such diversity of action is always assumed to be due to
the presence in the same fluid of different enzymes. Emil
<span class="nowrap">Fischer<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> has advanced the theory that the specificity of an
enzyme is related to the geometrical structure of the substance
undergoing change; <i>i. e.</i>, that each enzyme is capable
of acting upon or attaching itself only to such molecules
as have a definite structure with which the enzyme is in harmony.
Or, the enzyme may be considered as a key which will
fit only into the lock (structure) of the molecule it acts upon.</p>

<p>One characteristic feature of enzymes is the incompleteness
of their action. Thus, the enzyme of saliva transforms
starch by a series of progressive changes into soluble starch,
two or more dextrins, and the sugar maltose as the chief end-product.
A mixture of starch paste and saliva under ordinary
conditions, however, never results in the formation of
a hundred per cent of maltose, but there always remains a
variable amount of dextrin which appears to resist further
change. This is apparently due to what is known as the reversible
action of enzymes. Thus, the chemical reactions
involved here are reversible actions, <i>i. e.</i>, they take place in
opposite directions. The catalyzer not only accelerates or
incites a reaction in the direction of breaking down the substance
acted upon, but it also aids in the recomposition of
the products so formed into the original or kindred substance.
With reversible reactions of this sort the opposite changes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
sooner or later strike an equilibrium, which remains constant
until some alteration in the conditions brings about an
inequality and the reactions proceed until a new equilibrium
is established. In the body, however, where the circulating
blood and lymph provide facilities for the speedy removal by
absorption of the soluble products formed, the reaction may
proceed until the original substance undergoing change is
completely transformed into the characteristic end-product.
This reversible action of enzymes is an important feature,
and helps explain certain nutritional changes to be referred
to later. Whether all enzymes behave in this way is not as
yet determined.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of digestive enzymes is their extreme
sensitiveness to changes in their environment. Powerful in
their ability to transform relatively large quantities of a
given foodstuff into simple products better adapted for absorption
and utilization by the body, they are, however, quickly
checked in their action, and even destroyed, when the conditions
surrounding them are slightly interfered with. They
require for their best action a temperature closely akin to
that of the healthy body, and any great deviation therefrom
will result at once in an inhibition of their activity. Further,
they demand a certain definite reaction of the fluid or mixture,
if their working power is to be maintained at the maximum.
Indeed, many enzymes, like the ptyalin of saliva, are
quickly destroyed if the reaction is greatly changed. Enzymes
are thus seen to be more or less unstable substances,
endowed with great power as digestive agents, but sensitive
to a high degree and working advantageously only under
definite conditions. Many perversions of digestion and of
nutrition are connected not only with a lack of the proper
secretion of some one or more digestive enzyme, but also
with the lack of proper surroundings for the manifestation
of normal or maximum activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>With these statements before us, we can readily picture for
ourselves the initial results following the ingestion of starch-containing
foods properly cooked; and it may be mentioned
here that the cooking is an essential preliminary, for uncooked
starch cannot be utilized in any degree by man. With the
mind in a state of pleasurable anticipation, with freedom
from care and worry, which are so liable to act as deterrents
to free secretion, and with the food in a form which appeals
to the eye as well as to the olfactories, its thorough mastication
calls forth and prolongs vigorous salivary secretion, with
which the food becomes intimately intermingled. Salivary
digestion is thus at once incited, and the starch very quickly
commences to undergo the characteristic change into soluble
products. As mouthful follows mouthful, deglutition alternates
with mastication, and the mixture passes into the
stomach, where salivary digestion can continue for a limited
time only, until the secretion of gastric juice eventually establishes
in the stomach-contents a distinct acid reaction,
when salivary digestion ceases through destruction of the
starch-converting enzyme. Need we comment, in view of
the natural brevity of this process, upon the desirability for
purely physiological reasons of prolonging within reasonable
limits the interval of time the food and saliva are commingled
in the mouth cavity? It seems obvious, in view of
the relatively large bulk of starch-containing foods consumed
daily, that habits of thorough mastication should be fostered,
with the purpose of increasing greatly the digestion of starch
at the very gateway of the alimentary tract. It is true that
in the small intestine there comes later another opportunity
for the digestion of starch; but it is unphysiological, as it is
undesirable, for various reasons, not to take full advantage of
the first opportunity which Nature gives for the preparation
of this important foodstuff for future utilization. Further,
thorough mastication, by a fine comminution of the food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
particles, is a material aid in the digestion which is to take
place in the stomach and intestine. Under normal conditions,
therefore, and with proper observance of physiological good
sense, a large proportion of the ingested starchy foods can be
made ready for speedy absorption and consequent utilization
through the agency of salivary digestion.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the body do we find a more forcible illustration
of economical method in physiological processes than in
the mechanism of gastric secretion. Years ago, it was thought
that the flow of gastric juice was due mainly to mechanical
stimulation of the gastric glands by contact of the food
material with the lining membrane of the stomach. This,
however, is not the case, as Pawlow has clearly shown, and
it is now understood that the flow of gastric juice is started by
impulses which have their origin in the mouth and nostrils;
the sensations of eating, the smell, sight, and taste of food
serving as psychical stimuli, which call forth a secretion from
the stomach glands, just as the same stimuli may induce an
outpouring of saliva. These sensations, as Pawlow has ascertained,
affect secretory centres in the brain, and impulses are
thus started which travel downward to the stomach through
the vagus nerves, and as a result gastric juice begins to flow.
This process, however, is supplemented by other forms of
secretion, likewise reflex, which are incited by substances,
ready formed in the food, and by substances&mdash;products of
digestion&mdash;which are manufactured from the food in the
stomach. Soups, meat juice, and the extractives of meat,
likewise dextrin and kindred products, when present in the
stomach, are especially active in provoking secretion. Substances
which in themselves have less flavor, as water, milk,
etc., are far less effective in this direction, while the white
of eggs and bread are entirely without action in directly
stimulating secretion. When the latter foods have been in
the stomach for a time, however, and the proteid material has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
undergone partial digestion, then absorption of the products
so formed calls forth energetic secretion of gastric juice. It
is thus seen that there are three distinct ways&mdash;all reflex&mdash;by
which gastric juice is caused to flow into the stomach as
a prelude to gastric digestion. Further, it has been shown
by Pawlow that there is a relationship between the volume
and character of the gastric juice secreted and the amount
and composition of the food ingested, thus suggesting a certain
adjustment in the direction of physiological economy
well worthy of note. A diet of bread, for example, leads to
the secretion of a smaller volume of gastric juice than a corresponding
weight of meat produces, but the juice secreted
under the influence of bread is richer in pepsin and acid, <i>i. e.</i>,
it has a greater digestive action than the juice produced by
meat. The suggestion is that gastric juice assumes different
degrees of concentration, with different proportions of acid
and pepsin, to meet the varying requirements of a changing
dietary.</p>

<p>As has been indicated, pepsin and hydrochloric acid are
the important constituents of gastric juice. It is noteworthy,
however, that it is the combination of the two that is effective
in digestion. Pepsin without acid is of no avail, and
acid without pepsin can accomplish little in the digestion of
food. Pepsin and acid are secreted by different gland cells
in the stomach, and gastric insufficiency, or so-called indigestion,
may arise from either a condition of apepsia or
from hypoacidity. It is worthy of comment that the amount
of hydrochloric acid secreted during 24 hours by the normal
individual, under ordinary conditions of diet, amounts to
what would constitute a fatal dose of acid if taken at one time
in concentrated form. At the outset of gastric secretion, the
fluid shows only a slight degree of acidity, but as secretion
proceeds, the acidity rises to 0.2–0.3 per cent of hydrochloric
acid. The main action of gastric juice is exerted on proteid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
foods, which under its influence are gradually dissolved and
converted into soluble products known as proteoses and peptones.
It is a process of peptonization, in which the proteid
of the food is gradually broken down into so-called hydrolytic
cleavage products. The enzyme, like the ptyalin of saliva,
is influenced by temperature, maximum digestive action being
manifested at about 38°&nbsp;C., the temperature of the body.
Further, a certain degree of acidity is essential for procuring
the highest degree of efficiency. Ordinarily, it is stated that
digestive action proceeds best in the presence of 0.2 per cent
hydrochloric acid, but what is more essential for vigorous
digestion is a certain relationship between the acid, pepsin,
and proteid undergoing digestion. As pepsin and the amount
of proteid are increased, the amount of acid, and its percentage
somewhat, must be correspondingly increased if digestion
is to be maintained at the maximum.</p>

<p>Another important function of gastric juice is that of curdling
milk, due to the presence in the secretion of a peculiar
enzyme known as rennin. The latter ferment acts upon the
casein of milk,&mdash;the chief proteid constituent,&mdash;transforming
it into a related substance commonly called paracasein.
This then reacts with the calcium salts present in milk, forming
an insoluble curd or calcium compound. From this point
on, the digestion of milk-casein by gastric juice is the same as
that of any other solid proteid, it being gradually transformed
by the pepsin-acid into soluble cleavage products. Why gastric
juice should be provided with this special enzyme, capable
of acting solely on the casein of milk, can only be conjectured,
but we may assume that it has to do with the economical
use of this important food. As the sole nutriment of
the young, milk occupies a peculiar position as a foodstuff,
and being a liquid, its proteid constituent might easily escape
complete digestion were it to pass on too hastily through the
gastro-intestinal tract. Experiment has shown that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
liquid food alone is taken into the stomach it is pushed forward
into the small intestine in a comparatively short time.
Curdled as it is by rennin, however, casein must stay for a
longer period in the stomach, like any other solid food, and
its partial digestion by gastric juice thereby made certain.
For the reasons above stated, it is apparent why milk should
not be treated as a drink in our daily diet. Remembering
that when milk reaches the stomach it is converted into a
solid clot or curd, there is obvious reason for sipping it, instead
of taking it by the glassful, thereby favoring the formation
of small, individual clots instead of one large curd, and
thus facilitating instead of retarding digestion.</p>

<p>Among other factors in gastric digestion, the muscular
movements of the stomach walls are to be emphasized, since
we have here a mechanical aid to digestion of no small moment,
and likewise a means of accomplishing the onward
movement of the stomach contents. The outer walls of the
stomach are composed of a thick layer of circular muscular
fibres, especially conspicuous at the pyloric end of the organ,
where the latter is joined on to the intestine; a smaller, less
conspicuous layer of longitudinal muscle fibres, and some
oblique fibres. At the pylorus, the circular fibres are so
arranged as to form a structure which, aided by a peculiar
folding of the inner mucous membrane, serves as a sphincter,
closing off the stomach from the duodenum, the beginning of
the small intestine. The movements of the stomach were
first made the subject of careful investigation by Dr. Beaumont
in his study of the celebrated case of Alexis St. Martin,
a French Canadian, who, in 1822, was accidentally wounded
by the discharge of a musket, with the resultant formation of
a permanent fistulous opening in the stomach. Dr. Beaumont,
in the <span class="nowrap">description<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> of his observations, writes that “by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the alternate contractions and relaxations of these bands (of
muscle) a great variety of motion is induced on this organ
(the stomach), sometimes transversely, and at other times
longitudinally. These alternate contractions and relaxations,
when affecting the transverse diameter, produce what are
called <i>vermicular</i> or <i>peristaltic</i> motions.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When they all
act together, the effect is to lessen the cavity of the stomach,
and to press upon the contained aliment, if there be any in
the stomach. These motions not only produce a constant
disturbance, or <i>churning</i> of the contents of this organ, but
they compel them, at the same time, to revolve around the
interior, from point to point, and from one extremity to the
other.” Of more recent investigations, the most important
are those made by Cannon<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> with the X-ray apparatus. From
these later studies, it is evident that Dr. Beaumont’s view of
the entire stomach being involved in a general rotary movement
is not correct, since in reality the movements are confined
mainly to the pyloric end of the stomach, the fundus
or portion nearer the œsophagus not being directly involved.
This means that when food material passes into the stomach,
it may remain at the fundic end for some time more or less
undisturbed before admixture with the gastric juice occurs,
and under such conditions, until acidity creeps in, the salivary
digestion of starch can continue.</p>

<p>According to the observations of Cannon, the contractile
movements of the stomach commence shortly after the entrance
of food, the contractions starting from about the
middle of the stomach and passing on toward the pylorus.
These waves of contraction follow each other very closely,
certainly not more than one or two minutes apart, and perhaps
less, while the resulting movements bring about an
intimate commingling of food and gastric juice in the pyloric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
portion of the stomach; followed by a gradual diffusion of
the semi-fluid mixture into the fundus accompanied by a
gradual displacement of the more solid food in the latter
region. These movements of the stomach are more or less
automatic, arising from stimuli&mdash;the acid secreted&mdash;originating
in the stomach itself, although it is considered that the
movements are subject to some regulation from extrinsic
nerve fibres, such as the vagi and the splanchnics. As digestion
proceeds and the mass in the stomach becomes more
fluid, the pyloric sphincter relaxes and a certain amount of
the fluid material is forced into the intestine by the pressure
of the contraction wave. This is repeated at varying intervals,
depending presumably in some measure upon the consistency
of the mass in the stomach, until after some hours
of digestion the stomach is completely emptied.</p>

<p>Especially interesting and suggestive are the experiments
made by <span class="nowrap">Cannon<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> on the length of time the different types
of foodstuffs remain in the stomach. Using cats as subjects,
he found that fats remain for a long period in the stomach;
they leave that organ slowly, the discharge into the intestine
being at about the same rate as the absorption of fat
from the small intestine or its passage into the large intestine.
Carbohydrate foods, on the other hand, begin to leave the
stomach soon after their ingestion. They pass out rapidly,
and at the end of two hours reach a maximum amount in the
small intestine almost twice the maximum for proteids, and
two and a half times the maximum for fats, both of which
maxima are reached only at the end of four hours. Carbohydrates
remain in the stomach about half as long as proteids.
Proteids, Cannon finds, frequently do not leave the stomach
at all during the first half-hour after they are eaten. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
two hours, they accumulate in the small intestine to a degree
only slightly greater than that reached by carbohydrates an
hour and a half earlier. The departure of proteids from the
stomach is therefore slower at first than that of either fats or
carbohydrates. When a mixture of equal parts of carbohydrates
and proteids is fed, the discharge from the stomach is
intermediate in rapidity. When fat is added to either carbohydrates
or proteids it retards the passage of both foodstuffs
through the pylorus.</p>

<p>It is evident from what has been stated that the gastric
digestion of proteid foods is a comparatively slow process,
involving several hours of time; and further, that food material
in general remains in the stomach for varying periods,
dependent upon its chemical composition. It would appear
further, that relaxation of the pyloric sphincter, allowing
passage of chyme into the intestine, must depend somewhat
upon chemical stimulation, as this offers the most plausible
explanation of the diversity of action seen with the different
foodstuffs. As has been pointed out, gastric digestion is
primarily a process for the conversion of proteid food into
soluble products. It would be a mistake, however, to assume
that the digestion of proteid foods is complete in the stomach.
Stomach digestion is to be considered more as a preliminary
step, paving the way for further changes to be carried forward
by the combined action of intestinal and pancreatic
juice in the small intestine. The importance of gastric digestion
is frequently overrated. It is unquestionably an important
process, but not absolutely essential for the maintenance
of life. Dogs have lived and flourished with their stomachs
removed, the intestine being joined to the œsophagus. The
intestine is a much more important part of the alimentary
tract; it is likewise far more sensitive to changing conditions
than the stomach, and undoubtedly one function of the latter
organ is to protect the intestine and preserve it from insult.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
The stomach may be compared to a vestibule or reservoir,
capable of receiving without detriment moderately large
amounts of food, together with fluid, in different forms and
combinations, with the power to hold them there until by
action of the gastric juice they are so transformed that their
onward passage into the intestine can be permitted with perfect
safety. Then, small portions of the properly prepared
material may be discharged from time to time through the
pylorus without danger of overloading the intestine, and in
a form capable of undergoing rapid and complete digestion.
Further, the stomach as a reservoir is very useful in bringing
everything to a proper and constant temperature before
allowing its entry into the intestine. Another fact of some
importance is that, contrary to the general view, absorption
from the stomach of the products of digestion is not very
rapid under ordinary conditions. Even water and soluble
salts pass very slowly into the circulation from the stomach.
Like the partially digested food material, they are carried
forward through the pyloric sphincter into the intestine,
where absorption of all classes of material is most marked.</p>

<p>It is in the small intestine that both digestion and absorption
are seen at their best. It is here that all three classes of
foodstuffs are acted upon simultaneously through the agency
of the pancreatic juice, intestinal juice, and bile. Here, too,
are witnessed some of the most complicated and interesting
reactions and changes occurring in the whole range of digestive
functions. Especially noteworthy is the peculiar mechanism
by which the secretion of pancreatic juice is set up and
maintained. On demand, pancreatic juice is manufactured
in the pancreas and poured into the intestine just beyond the
pylorus through a small duct&mdash;the duct of Wirsung. Secretion
is started by contact of the acid contents of the stomach
with the mucous membrane of the small intestine, so that as
soon as the acid chyme passes through the pyloric sphincter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
there commences an outflow of pancreatic juice into the intestine.
While acid is plainly the inciting agent in this
secretory process, its action is indirect. It does not cause
secretion through reflex action on nerve fibres, but it acts
upon a substance formed in the mucous membrane of the intestine,
transforming it into <i>secretin</i>, which is absorbed by
the blood and carried to the pancreas, where it excites secretory
activity. As would be expected from the foregoing
statements, the secretion of pancreatic juice commences very
soon after food finds its way into the stomach, and naturally
increases in amount with the onward passage of acid chyme
into the intestine, the maximum flow being obtained in the
neighborhood of the third or fourth hour, after which the
secretion gradually decreases. In man, it is estimated on
the basis of one or two observations that the amount secreted
during 24 hours is about 700&nbsp;cc., or a pint and a half. Careful
experiments, however, tend to show that the quantity of
secretion depends in some measure at least upon the character
of the food, and also that the composition of the secretion
varies with the character of the food. Thus, on a diet composed
mainly of meat, the proteid-digesting enzyme is especially
conspicuous, while on a bread diet, with its large
content of starch, the starch-digesting enzyme is increased in
amount. In other words, there is suggested the possibility
of an adaptation in the composition of the secretion to the
character of the food to be digested.</p>

<p>Pancreatic juice is an alkaline fluid, rather strongly alkaline
in fact, from its content of sodium carbonate, and is
especially characterized by the presence of at least three
distinct enzymes; viz., trypsin, a proteid-digesting ferment;
lipase, a fat-splitting enzyme; and amylopsin, a starch-digesting
enzyme. It has already been pointed out how
dependent the secretion of pancreatic juice is upon the co-operation
of the intestinal mucous membrane. A similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
dependence is found when the digestive activity of the secretion
is studied. As just stated, pancreatic juice contains a
proteid-digesting enzyme. This statement, however, is not
strictly correct, for if the secretion is collected through a
cannula so that it does not come in contact with the mucous
membrane of the intestine, it is found free from any digestive
action on proteids. The secretion is activated, however,
by contact with the duodenal membrane. Expressed
in different language, pancreatic juice as it is secreted by the
gland does not contain ready-formed trypsin; it does contain,
however, an inactive pro-enzyme, which, under the influence
of a specific substance contained in the intestinal
mucous membrane, known as enterokinase, is transformed
into the active enzyme trypsin. There is thus seen another
suggestive example of the close physiological relationship
between the small intestine and the activity of the pancreatic
gland, or its secretion.</p>

<p>The chemical changes taking place in the small intestine
are many and varied. The acid chyme, with its admixture
of semi-digested food material, as it passes through the pyloric
sphincter into the small intestine, is at once brought into
immediate contact with bile, pancreatic juice, and intestinal
juice, all of which are more or less alkaline in reaction. As
a result, the acidity of the gastric juice is rapidly overcome,
and the enzyme pepsin, which up to this point could exert
its characteristic digestive action, is quickly destroyed by the
accumulating alkaline salts. Pepsin digestion thus gives way
to trypsin digestion,&mdash;most effective in an alkaline medium,&mdash;and
the proteids of the food, already semi-digested by
pepsin-acid, are further transformed by trypsin; aided and
abetted by another enzyme, known as erepsin, secreted by
the mucous membrane of the intestine. These two enzymes
are much more powerful agents than pepsin. It is true that
they begin work where pepsin left off, but most striking is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
the character of the end-products which result from their
combined action, since they are small molecules and there
is a surprising diversity of them. In other words, while
gastric digestion breaks down the proteid foodstuffs into soluble
bodies, such as proteoses and peptones closely related to
the original proteids, in pancreatic digestion as it takes place
in the intestine there is a profound breaking down, or disruption
of the proteid molecule into a row of comparatively
simple nitrogenous fragments, many of them crystalline bodies;
such as leucin, tyrosin, glutaminic acid, aspartic acid, arginin,
lysin, histidin, etc., known chemically as monoamino-acids
and diamino-acids. We have no means of knowing to how
great an extent these more profound disruptive changes of
the proteid molecule take place in the intestine. Whether
practically all of the ingested proteid food is broken down
into these relatively simple compounds prior to absorption, or
whether only a small fraction suffers this change, cannot be
definitely stated.</p>

<p>A few years ago, the majority of physiologists held to the
view that in the digestion of proteid food all that was essential
was its conversion into soluble and diffusible forms which
would permit of ready absorption into the blood. The belief
was prevalent that, since the proteid of the food was destined
to make good the proteid of the blood and through the latter
the proteids of the tissues, any change beyond what was
really necessary for absorption of the proteid would be uneconomical
and indeed wasteful. On the other hand, due
weight must be given to the fact that in trypsin digestion,
proteid can be quickly broken down into simple nitrogenous
compounds, and that in the enzyme erepsin, present in the
mucous membrane of the intestine, we have an additional
ferment very efficient in bringing about cleavage of proteoses
and peptone into amino-acids. From these latter facts it might
be argued that, in the digestion of proteid foodstuffs by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
combined action of gastric and pancreatic juice in the alimentary
tract, a large proportion of the proteid is destined to
undergo complete conversion into amino-acids, and that from
these fragments the body, by a process of synthesis, can construct
its own peculiar type of proteid.</p>

<p>This latter suggestion is worthy of a moment’s further consideration.
As is well known, every species of animal has
its own particular type of proteid, adapted to its particular
needs. The proteids of one species directly injected into the
blood of another species are incapable of serving as nutriment
to the body, and frequently act as poisons. Man in his wide
choice of food consumes a great variety of proteids, all different
in some degree from the proteids of his own tissues. Is
it not possible, therefore, that it is the true function of pancreatic
and intestinal digestion to break down the different
proteids of the food completely into simple fragments, so that
the body can reconstruct after its own particular pattern the
proteids essential for its nourishment? Or, we can follow
the suggestion contained in the work of Abderhalden<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> who
finds that in the long continued digestion of various proteids
by pancreatic juice there results in addition to the amino-acids
a very resistant residue, non-proteid in nature, which
is termed polypeptid. In other words, Abderhalden believes
that pepsin, trypsin, and erepsin are not capable of bringing
about a <i>complete</i> breaking down of proteids into amino-acids,
but that there always remains a nucleus of the proteid not
strictly proteid in nature, though related thereto,&mdash;polypeptid,&mdash;which
may serve as a starting-point for the synthesis
or construction of new proteid molecules, the various
amino-acids being employed to finish out the structure and
give the particular character desired. This view, however,
is rendered somewhat untenable by the more recent experiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
of Cohnheim<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> who claims that proteids can be <i>completely</i>
broken down by pepsin, trypsin, and erepsin, and consequently
polypeptids would hardly be available for the synthesis of proteids.
Moreover, Bergell and <span class="nowrap">Lewin<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> have ascertained that
there is present in the liver an enzyme or ferment which has
the power of digesting or breaking down certain dipeptids
and polypeptids into amino-acids. Hence, it follows that if
any polypeptids are absorbed from the intestine, they would
naturally be carried to the liver, where further cleavage into
fragments suitable for synthetical processes might occur. In
any event, there is good ground for the belief that the more
or less complete disruption of the proteid molecule into small
fragments renders possible a synthetical construction of new
proteid to meet the demands of the organism; a fact of great
importance in our conception of the possibilities connected
with this phase of proteid nutrition.</p>

<p>Fatty foods undergo little or no chemical alteration until
they reach the small intestine. During their stay in the
stomach they naturally become liquid from the heat of
the body, and there is more or less liberation of fat from
the digestive action of gastric juice on cell walls, connective
tissues, etc. Most food fat is in the form of so-called neutral
fat, which must undergo hydrolysis or saponification
before it can be absorbed and thus made available for the
body. This is accomplished by the enzyme lipase, or steapsin,
of the pancreatic juice, aided indirectly by the presence
of bile. Under the influence of this fat-splitting enzyme all
neutral fats, whether animal or vegetable, are broken apart,
through hydrolysis, into glycerin and a free fatty acid; the
latter reacting in some measure with the sodium carbonate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the pancreatic juice to form a sodium salt, or soluble soap,
while perhaps the larger part of the fatty acid is held in solution
by the bile present. Soap, free acid, and glycerin are then
absorbed from the intestine and are found again combined in
the lymph as neutral fat. In this way the fats of the food
are rendered available for the nourishment of the body.</p>

<p>The next important chemical change taking place in the
small intestine is that induced by the amylopsin of the pancreatic
juice, which, acting in essentially the same manner as
the ptyalin of saliva, converts any unaltered starch into dextrins
and sugar. The latter substance, maltose, is exposed
to the action of another enzyme contained in the intestinal
secretion termed maltase, which transforms it into dextrose,
a monosaccharide.</p>

<p>In these ways the proteids, fats, and carbohydrates of the
food are gradually digested, so far as conditions will admit,
digestion being practically completed by the time the material
reaches the ileocæcal valve at the beginning of the
large intestine. Throughout the length of the small intestine
absorption proceeds rapidly; water, salts, and the products
of digestion passing out from the intestine into the circulating
blood and lymph. At the ileocæcal valve, however,
the contents of the intestine are practically as fluid as at the
beginning of the small intestine, due to the fact that water
is continually being secreted into the intestine. In the large
intestine, the contents become less and less fluid through
reabsorption of the water, and as the propulsive movements
of the circular and longitudinal muscle fibres of the intestinal
wall carry the material onward toward the rectum, the last
portions of available nutriment are absorbed. Finally, in
varying degree, certain putrefactive changes are observed in
the large intestine involving a breaking down of some residual
proteid matter, through the agency of micro-organisms
almost invariably present, with formation of such substances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
as indol, skatol, phenol, fatty acids, etc. These processes,
however, in health are held rigidly in check, and count for
little in fitting the food for absorption. Digestion, on the
other hand, extending as we have seen from the mouth cavity
to the ileocæcal valve, is the handmaiden of nutrition, preparing
all three classes of organic foodstuffs for their passage
into the circulating blood and lymph, and thus paving the
way for their utilization by the hungry tissue cells.</p>

<p>Digestion being completed, and the available portion
of the foodstuffs thereby converted into forms suitable
for absorption, the question naturally arises, In what manner
are these products transported from the alimentary tract to the
tissues and organs of the body? In attempting to answer
this question, we shall find many illustrations of the precise
and undeviating methods which prevail in the processes of
nutrition. For example, it would seem plausible to assume
that the different forms of sugar entering into man’s ordinary
diet, all of them being soluble, would be directly absorbed
and at once utilized, but such is far from being the
case. Milk-sugar and cane-sugar, both appearing in greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
or less degree in our daily dietaries, if introduced directly
into the blood, are at once excreted through the kidneys unchanged.
The body cannot use them, and they are gotten
rid of as speedily as possible, much as if they were poisons.
When taken by way of the mouth, however, they are utilized,
simply because in the intestine two enzymes are present there,
known as lactase and invertase, which break each of the
sugars apart into two smaller molecules. In other words,
milk-sugar and cane-sugar are disaccharides, and if they are to
be absorbed in forms capable of being made use of by the body
they must be split apart into simpler sugars, viz., monosaccharides,
such as dextrose, levulose, etc. The great bulk
of the carbohydrate food consumed by man is in the form of
starch, and this, as we have seen, is converted into maltose
by the action of saliva and pancreatic juice. Maltose, however,
like cane-sugar, is a disaccharide, and the body has no
power to burn it or utilize it directly; but in the intestine
and elsewhere is an enzyme termed maltase, which breaks
up maltose into two molecules of the monosaccharide dextrose,
and this the body can use. Man frequently consumes
starch to the extent of a pound a day, and if utilized it must
all undergo transformation into maltose, and then into dextrose.
There is no apparent reason why maltose should not
be absorbed and assimilated as readily as dextrose, but so
urgent is the necessity for this conversion into dextrose that
in the blood itself there is present maltase, to effect the transformation
of any maltose that may gain entrance there. We
are here face to face with a simple fact in nutrition. The
body cannot utilize disaccharides directly. Why it is so we
cannot say, but the fact is a good illustration of the principle
that nothing can be taken for granted in our study of
nutrition.</p>

<p>For years, physiologists assumed that the ordinary physical
laws of osmosis, imbibition, and diffusion were quite adequate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
to explain the passage of digested food materials into
the blood and lymph. If a substance was soluble and diffusible,
that was sufficient; it would quite naturally be absorbed
in harmony with its diffusion velocity. This, however, is
not wholly true, since experiment shows that the rapidity of
absorption of diffusible substances through the wall of the
intestine is by no means always proportional to the diffusion
velocity of the substance. The lining membrane of the
small intestine, where absorption mainly takes place, is not
to be compared to a dead parchment membrane. On the
contrary, it is made up of living protoplasmic cells; absorption
is not a physical, but a physiological, process, in which
the living epithelium cells stand as guardians of the portals,
ready to challenge and, if need be, modify the rate of passage.
Osmosis and diffusion undoubtedly play some part in
absorption, but they alone are not sufficient to account for
what actually takes place in the absorption of digestion
products, and other substances from the living intestine.</p>

<p>The primary products formed in the digestion of proteid
foods&mdash;the proteoses and peptones&mdash;afford another illustration
of physiological peculiarity in absorption. These bodies
are readily soluble and quite diffusible, yet they are never
found to any extent in the circulating blood and lymph during
health. It is of course possible, as has been previously
suggested, that as soon as formed they undergo transformation
into simpler decomposition products in the small intestine;
but this is by no means certain. If proteoses and
peptones are injected directly into the blood, they cause a
marked disturbance, influencing at once blood-pressure, affecting
the coagulability of the blood, and in many other ways
exhibiting a pronounced deleterious action which at once indicates
they are out of their normal environment. They are
not at home in the circulating blood, and the latter medium
gets rid of them as speedily as possible; they behave like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
veritable poisons, and yet they are the primary products
formed in the digestion of all proteid foodstuffs. On the
basis of all physical laws governing diffusion they should be
absorbed, and help to renew the proteids of the blood and
later the proteids of the tissues. Yet, as we have said, they
are not normally present in the blood or lymph. Apparently,
in the very act of absorption, as they pass through the epithelial
cells of the intestinal wall, before they gain entrance to
the blood stream, they undergo transformation into serum-albumin
and globulin, the characteristic blood proteids. The
other alternative is that, as previously mentioned, they are
completely broken down in the intestine into amino-acids,
etc., and these simpler products synthesized, as they pass
through the intestinal wall toward the blood, into serum-albumin
and globulin. Certainly as yet, there is no evidence
that the amino-acids, as such, go through the epithelial cells
of the intestine; they are not found in the blood or lymph to
any appreciable extent, yet the proteids of the blood are reinforced
in some manner by the products of proteid digestion.
Whichever view is correct, one thing is perfectly obvious,
viz., that in the act of absorption the products resulting from
the gastric and pancreatic digestion of proteid foods are exposed
to some influence, presumably in the epithelial cells
of the intestinal wall, by which there is a reconstruction of
proteid. Further, the proteid substances so formed are of the
type peculiar to the blood of that particular species of animal.
The proteids of beef, mutton, chicken, oatmeal, or bread go
to make the proteids of human blood.</p>

<p>From these statements, it is obvious that what we term absorption
is something more than a simple diffusion of soluble
substances from the alimentary tract into the blood current.
The process is much more complex than appears on the surface,
and our lack of definite knowledge, in spite of numerous
efforts to unravel the mystery, merely strengthens the view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
that we are dealing here with an obscure physiological problem,
and not a simple physical one. Digestion induces a splitting
up of the food proteid into fragments, large or small, while
incidental to absorption there is apparently a reconstruction,
or synthesis, of proteid from the fragments so formed. The
process seems somewhat costly, physiologically speaking, yet
when one considers the variety of proteids consumed as food,
it is easy to comprehend how essential it is that in some
manner, as in absorption, there be opportunity for construction
of the specific proteids of the blood and lymph.</p>

<p>We find an analogous process in the absorption of fats.
As we have seen, the fats of the food are broken apart in the
small intestine into glycerin and free fatty acid, a portion
of the latter, and perhaps all, combining with the alkali of the
intestinal juices to form soluble soaps, or sodium salts of the
respective fatty acids. The neutral fats present in animal
and vegetable foods are all alike in containing the glyceryl
radicle, but they differ in the character of the fatty acids
present. Further, one form of animal fat, like that from beef,
may contain quite a different proportion of stearin, palmitin,
and olein than is present in the fat of another animal, like
mutton. By digestion, however, they are all broken apart
into fatty acid and glycerin. These acids and their salts can
be readily detected in the intestine, but they are not found
in the blood or lymph, yet shortly after fatty food is taken
the lymph is seen to be milky from fat. Obviously, the fatty
acids liberated in the intestine are absorbed, either as soluble
soaps or as free fatty acids dissolved in bile, but as they pass
through the epithelial cells of the intestine into the lacteal
radicles, there is a synthesis or reconstruction of fat; and as
a result, neutral fats and not soaps are found in the lymph.
Here, then, we have a process quite analogous to what apparently
occurs in the absorption of proteid, though less complex;
and it is possible that this is one of the factors which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
aids in the formation of a specific fat mixture corresponding,
in a measure, to the type of fat present in the particular species.
It is well understood that the fat of an animal’s tissues
may be modified somewhat by the character of the fat fed, yet
in spite of this there is a certain degree of constancy in composition
which calls for explanation. Sheep and oxen feeding
in the same pasture have fat widely different in the
proportion of stearin, palmitin, etc. The fat of man’s tissues
is fairly definite in composition, yet he eats a great variety of
fatty foods. One man may consume large amounts of hard
mutton fat with its relatively large content of stearin, while
another individual may take his fat mainly in the form of the
soft butter fats, with their relatively large content of olein
and palmitin. In both cases, the fat of the man’s tissues will
be essentially the same. To be sure, the changes that take
place in the tissue cells, reinforced by the construction of
fat from other sources, may be partly responsible for this
constancy of composition, but the transformations incidental
to absorption are quite possibly, in some measure, helpful
thereto.</p>

<p>The great bulk of the digested food material is absorbed
from the small intestine, and there are two pathways open
through which the absorbed material can gain access to the
blood. The one path leads directly to the liver, and substances
taking this course are exposed to the action of this
organ, before they enter into the general circulation. The
other path is through the lacteal or lymphatic system, and
constitutes a roundabout way for substances to enter the
blood stream, since they must first pass through the thoracic
duct before entering the main circulation. As a general
truth, it may be stated that fats are absorbed through the
latter channel, while carbohydrates and proteids follow the
first path. The innumerable blood capillaries in the villi of
the intestine take up the products resulting from the digestion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of proteids and carbohydrates, through which they are
passed into the portal vein, and thereby distributed throughout
the liver. This means that both carbohydrates and proteids&mdash;or
their decomposition products&mdash;are exposed to a
variety of possible changes in this large glandular organ,
before they can enter into the tissues of the body. As we
have seen, practically all carbohydrate food is converted into
a monosaccharide, principally dextrose, in the alimentary
tract; and it is in this form of a simple sugar that the carbohydrate
passes into the blood. This might easily mean a
pound of sugar absorbed during the twenty-four hours, and
would obviously give to the blood a high degree of concentration,
unless the excess was quickly disposed of. Sugar is
very diffusible, and if it accumulates to any extent in the
blood it is quickly gotten rid of by excretion through the
kidneys. This, however, is wasteful, physiologically and
otherwise, and does not ordinarily occur except in diseased
conditions. Further, physiologists have learned that a certain
small, but definite, amount of sugar in the blood is a
necessary requirement in nutrition, and it is the function of
the liver to maintain the proper carbohydrate level.</p>

<p>We must again emphasize the great importance of carbohydrate
food; there is a far larger amount of starchy food
consumed than of any other foodstuff, and it is more readily
available as a source of energy. Its presence in the blood,
in the form of sugar, is constantly demanded, but it must be
kept within the proper limits for the uses of the different
tissues and organs of the body. The liver serves as an effective
regulator, maintaining, in spite of all fluctuations in the
supply and demand, a definite percentage of sugar such as is
best adapted to keep the tissues of the body in a normal and
healthy condition. This regulation by the liver is rendered
possible through the ability of the hepatic cells to transform
the sugar brought to the gland into glycogen, so-called animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
starch, which is stored up in the liver until such time as it is
needed by the body. The process is one of dehydration, the
reverse of what takes place in the intestine when ordinary
starch is converted into maltose and dextrose. The efficiency
of this regulating mechanism depends also upon the ability of
the liver to transform glycogen into sugar, presumably through
the agency of an enzyme in the hepatic cells. Hence, glycogen
may be looked upon as a temporary reserve supply of
carbohydrate, manufactured and stored in the liver during
digestion, when naturally large amounts of sugar are passing
into the portal blood, and to be drawn upon whenever from
any cause the content of sugar in the blood threatens to
fall below normal. Obviously, there must be some delicate
machinery for the adjustment of these opposite changes in
the liver, and we may well believe that it is associated with
the composition of the blood itself, which in some fashion
stimulates and inhibits, as may be required, the functional
activity of the liver, or its component cells. In any event,
we have in this so-called glycogenic function of the liver a
most effective means for accomplishing the complete and
judicious utilization of all the sugar formed from the carbohydrates
of the food, after it has once passed beyond the confines
of the alimentary tract into the blood; preventing all
loss, and at the same time guarding against all danger, from
undue accumulation of sugar in the circulation. We see,
too, how wise the provision that all sugar should pass from
the alimentary canal into the portal circulation and not by
way of the lymphatics, since by the latter channel the regulating
action of the liver would be mainly lost. Further, recalling
how soluble and diffusible sugar is, we may well marvel
that it practically all passes from the intestine by way of the
blood, and escapes entry into the lymphatics. Surely, this
marked shunning of the other equally accessible pathway
affords a striking illustration of selective action such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
might be expected in a physiological process, but not in harmony
with the ordinary physical laws of osmosis or diffusion.
In conformity with this statement, it may be mentioned that
appropriate experiments have clearly demonstrated that the
different sugars available as food are not absorbed from the
intestine in harmony with their diffusion velocity, but show
deviations therefrom which can be explained only on the
ground that the intestinal wall exercises some selective action,
due to the living cells composing it. Likewise interesting in
their bearing on nutrition are the observations of Hofmeister<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span>
who finds by experiments on dogs that the assimilation limit
of the different sugars shows marked variation. Thus, dextrose,
levulose, and cane-sugar have the highest assimilation,
while milk-sugar is far less easily and completely assimilated.
If this is equally true of man, it indicates that starchy foods,
with their ultimate conversion into dextrose, are to be ranked
as having a high assimilation limit, thus affording additional
evidence of their high nutritive value.</p>

<p>In the absorption of proteid products, their passage from
the intestine by way of the portal circulation insures exposure
to the action of the hepatic cells, before they are distributed
by the general circulation throughout the body. It is
only under conditions of an excessive intake of proteid foods
that their products are absorbed by way of the lymphatics.
These points are clearly established, and there is every ground
for believing that substantial reasons exist to account for this
single line of departure. Just what the liver does, however,
is uncertain. In fact, as already indicated, there is lack of
definite knowledge as to how far the proteid foods are broken
down in digestion, prior to absorption. The combined action
of pepsin, trypsin, and erepsin, if sufficiently long continued,
can accomplish a complete disruption of the proteid molecule.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
We are inclined to assume in a general way that the “proteids
taken as food cannot find a place in the economy of the
animal body till they have been, as it were, melted down and
recast.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> How far this melting down or disruption extends
in normal digestion, we do not at present know. As already
stated, neither proteoses and peptones, nor the amino-acids, are
found in the blood stream in sufficient amounts, or with that
frequency, to suggest absorption in these forms. Possibly, as
some physiologists have suggested, the amount of any of these
products to be found at any one time in a given quantity of
blood is too small for certain recognition, yet in the twenty-four
hours the amount passing from intestine to liver might be
sufficiently large to equal the total proteid absorbed. We can,
however, at present only conjecture, and must rest content
with the simple statement that in the digestion of the proteid
foodstuffs, proteoses, peptones, and amino-acids are
formed, and that by transformation or total reconstruction of
these products, special types of proteid are manufactured
either in the epithelial cells of the intestinal walls during
absorption, or elsewhere in the body after absorption. If this
latter is the case, the liver might readily be regarded as a
likely spot for the synthesis to occur.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind what has been said regarding the production
of specific types of proteid by every species of animal,
we can the more readily conceive of a synthesis “out of
fragments of the original molecules rearranged and put together
in new combinations, by processes in which the intestine
can hardly be supposed to play a part.” This, the liver
might well be assumed as capable of accomplishing, and if
we were disposed to accept this view we might use as an
argument the fact that the products of proteid digestion
are taken directly to this organ, before being cast loose in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
the tissues and organs of the body. There is perhaps as
good ground for assuming that a synthesis or reconstruction
of proteid takes place all over the body; that, as suggested
by Leathes, “the synthesis of proteids is a function
of every cell in the body, each one for itself, and that the
material out of which all proteids in the body are made is
not proteid in any form, but the fragments derived from
proteids by hydrolysis, probably the amido-acids, which in
different combinations and different proportions are found
in all proteids, and into which they are all resolved by the
processes, autolytic or digestive, which can be carried out
in every cell in the body.” It is certainly a reasonable
hypothesis, and since we lack positive knowledge it cannot
at present be disproved. All that we can affirm in the light
of established fact is that the products of proteid digestion are
absorbed from the intestine by way of the portal circulation,
and that either in their passage through the intestinal wall,
or later on in the liver or elsewhere, there is a construction
of new proteid to meet the wants of the body. The liver,
indeed, may be effective in both construction and destruction
of proteid, but there is no way of telling at present just
how far it acts in either direction.</p>

<p class="mb18em">Regarding the absorption of fats, a single statement will
suffice, in addition to what has already been said. Fats gain
access to the general circulation by passing from the intestine
into the lacteal radicles, thence into the lymphatics, whence
they move onward into the thoracic duct, and from there are
emptied into the great veins at the neck. A small amount
is apparently absorbed in the form of soap by the portal circulation,
but by far the larger amount of fat gains access to
the blood stream without going through the liver.</p>

<p>In these ways, the blood and lymph are continually supplied
with proteid, fat, and carbohydrate from the ingested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
food, and as these fluids surround and permeate the organized
elements of the tissues, the latter are enabled to gain
what they need to maintain their nutritive balance. Living
matter is essentially unstable; it is the seat of chemical
changes of various kinds, anabolic or constructive, and katabolic
or destructive. The more comprehensive term “metabolic”
is applied to all of these changes that take place in
living matter. In anabolism, the dead, inert proteids, fats,
and carbohydrates are more or less assimilated and made a
part of the living matter of the tissue cells, while at the same
time a certain amount of the food material, probably the
larger amount, is simply stored as such, or left to circulate in
the blood and lymph, without being raised to the higher level
of living protoplasm. In katabolism, this accumulated material,
and in some degree the living substance itself, is broken
down or disintegrated with liberation of the stored-up energy,
which manifests itself in the form of heat and mechanical
work. At times, the anabolic processes predominate and
there is a relatively large accumulation of stored-up materials;
while at other times, katabolism, with its attendant chemical
decompositions, predominates, and the body loses correspondingly.
The point to be emphasized here is that the living
body, with its multitude of living cells, is the seat of incessant
change. Construction and destruction are continually
going forward side by side; sometimes the one and sometimes
the other predominating, according to existing conditions.
The living protoplasm with its attendant storage material is,
under ordinary conditions, constantly being made good from
the assimilated food, a part of which is raised to the dignity
of living matter and becomes an integral part of the living
cells, while the larger portion is simply stored for future
uses, or circulates in the blood and lymph which bathe them.
Doubtless, this storage or circulating material is the main
source of the energy which constantly flows from the cells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
in the form of heat and of work, as a result of the disruptive
changes that constitute katabolism.</p>

<p>Worthy of special notice is the fact that cell protoplasm
is essentially proteid in nature; water and proteid make
up the larger part of its substance, to which are added
small proportions of carbohydrate, fat, and mineral matter.
Proteid is the basis of cell protoplasm; it is the chemical
nucleus of living matter, and owing to the large size of
its molecule, with its large number of contained atoms, is
capable of many combinations and many alterations. Most
of the reactions characteristic of katabolism centre around
this proteid, but the disruptive changes that occur undoubtedly
involve more largely the circulating materials present
in the blood and lymph, and which bathe the cells, rather
than the so-called fixed, or organ proteid, of the cell substance
itself. Still, while the circulating blood and lymph
furnish largely the substances which are made to undergo
disintegration in katabolism, the living protoplasmic cell is
the controlling power which regulates the extent and character
of the decompositions, and proteid matter is the chemical
basis of protoplasm. From these statements, we again
have suggested the significant importance of the proteid foods
in nutrition, since they alone can furnish the material which
constitutes the chemical basis of living cells. The human
body, which represents the highest form of animal life, is
merely, as stated by another, “literally a nation of cells derived
from a single cell called the ovum, living together, but
dividing the work, transformed variously into tissues and
organs, and variously surrounded by protoplasm products”
(Waller).</p>

<p>The processes involved in metabolism are not easily unravelled.
The word itself is simple, but it is employed to
designate that complex of “chemical changes in living organisms
which constitute their life, the changes by which their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
food is assimilated and becomes part of them, the changes
which it undergoes while it shares their life, and finally those
by which it is returned to the condition of inanimate matter.
Gathered together under this one phrase are some of the most
intricate and inaccessible of natural phenomena. It implies
also, and gently insists on the idea, that all the phenomena
of life are at bottom chemical reactions” (Leathes). Regarding
the processes of anabolism, as in the construction of
living protoplasm out of inert food materials, we can say
nothing. This is altogether beyond our ken at present, and
doubtless will remain so, since it involves a chemical alteration,
or change, akin to that of bringing the dead to life. With
the processes of katabolism, however, we may hope for more
satisfactory results; and, indeed, to-day we have considerable
information of value as to some of the methods, at least,
which are the cause of this phase of nutrition. This knowledge,
however, has been slow of attainment.</p>

<p>In the earlier years of the sixteenth century, when anatomy
and physiology were beginning to make progress, the savants
of that day, hampered as they were by grave misconceptions
and by the lack of any understanding of chemical phenomena,
could not take advantage, naturally, of the suggestion that as
wood burns or oxidizes in the air with liberation of heat, so
might the food substances, absorbed by the body, undergo
oxidation in the tissues and thus give rise to animal heat.
Such suggestions were at that time as a closed book, and so
we find Vesalius, in 1543, teaching the Galenic doctrines in
physiology then prevalent. The conception of heat production,
as it existed at that time, may be inferred from the following
quotation<span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> “The parts of the food absorbed from
the alimentary canal are carried by the portal blood to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
liver, and by the influence of that great organ are converted
into blood. The blood thus enriched by the food is by the
same great organ endued with the nutritive properties summed
up in the phrase ‘natural spirits.’ But blood thus endowed
with natural spirits is still crude blood, unfitted for the
higher purposes of the blood in the body. Carried from the
liver by the vena cava to the right side of the heart, some of
it passes from the right ventricle through innumerable invisible
pores in the septum to the left ventricle. As the heart
expands it draws from the lungs through the vein-like artery
air into the left ventricle. And in that left cavity, the blood
which has come through the septum is mixed with the air
thus drawn in, and by the help of that heat, which is innate
in the heart, which was placed there as the source of the heat
of the body by God in the beginning of life, and which remains
there until death, is imbued with further qualities, is
laden with ‘vital spirits,’ and so fitted for its higher duties.
The air thus drawn into the left heart by the pulmonary vein,
at the same time tempers the innate heat of the heart and
prevents it from becoming excessive.” In other words, heat
was considered as a divine gift, and as can readily be seen,
there was an utter lack of appreciation of the use of air in
breathing. Even van Helmont, who lived in 1577–1644,
and was in a sense an alchemist, still gave credence to the
spirits, viz., that the food absorbed from the stomach and
intestine is in the liver endued with natural spirits, while in
the heart the natural spirits are converted into vital spirits,
and in the brain the vital spirits are transformed into animal
spirits<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> Later, Malpighi discovered the true structure of
the lungs, and Borelli, in 1680, exposed the erroneous views
then prevalent regarding the purpose of breathing. It is not
true, says Borelli, that the use of breathing is to cool the excessive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
heat of the heart or to ventilate the vital flame, but
we must believe that this great machinery of the lungs, with
their accompanying blood vessels, is for some grand purpose.
In a long and vigorous argument, he contends that the “air
taken in by breathing is the chief cause of the life of animals,
far more essential than the working of the heart and the circulation
of the blood.” He quotes the experiments of Boyle,
who showed in 1660 “that even in a partial vacuum brought
about by his air pump, flame was extinguished and life soon
came to an end; the candle went out and the mouse or the
sparrow died.”</p>

<p>At this time, and for long afterwards, the belief was prevalent
that the air taken up by the blood in the lungs was
the air of the atmosphere in its entirety. No one appears to
have thought of the possibility of only a part of the air being
used, for at that time there was no suspicion that air was a
mixture of substances. Mayow, however, in 1668, showed
that it was not the whole air which was employed for respiration,
but a particular part only. At this time, great attention
was being given to a study of nitre or saltpetre; its wonderful
properties in combustion were being recognized, and
Mayow, who was a chemist of repute, claimed that it had its
origin partly in the air and partly in the earth. The air
“which surrounds us, and which, since by its tenuity escapes
the sharpness of our eyes, seems to those who think about
it to be an empty space, is impregnated with a certain universal
salt, of a nitro-saline nature, that is to say, with a
vital, fiery, and in the highest degree fermentative spirit,” to
which the name of “igneo-aereus” was applied. Nitre was
shown to be composed of a <i>sal fixum</i> or sal alkali,&mdash;potash as
it is now called,&mdash;and was obviously derived from the earth,
while the other part of nitre was made up of the <i>spiritus
acidus</i>, or nitric acid. For a time it was supposed that the
whole of this <i>spiritus acidus</i> was contained in the atmosphere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
but it was soon recognized that this could not be the
case, since nitric acid was found to be a corrosive liquid, destructive
to life and quite incapable of supporting combustion.
Hence, Mayow concluded that only a part of the acid
exists in the atmosphere, viz., that part which he termed
<i>spiritus nitro-aereus</i>. In combustion, there is something in
the air which is necessary for the burning of every flame,
unless perchance igneo-aereal particles should pre-exist in
the thing to be burnt. These igneo-aereal particles form
“the more active and subtle part of air which is thus necessary
for combustion, exist in nitre and indeed constitute its
‘more active and fiery part.’” Mayow fully recognized that
burning and breathing involved in a measure the same process;
both consisted in the consumption of the igneo-aereal particles
present in the air. “If a small animal and a lighted
candle be shut up in the same vessel, the entrance into which
of air from without be prevented, you will see in a short
time the candle go out, nor will the animal long survive its
funeral torch. Indeed, [says Mayow] I have found by observation
that an animal shut up in a flask together with
a candle will continue to breathe for not much more than
half the time than it otherwise would, that is, without the
candle.” Something contained in the air, necessary alike
for supporting combustion and for sustaining life, passes
from the air into the blood. Mayow expressed his thoughts
in these words: “And indeed it is very probable that certain
particles of a nitro-saline nature, and those very subtle,
nimble, and of very great fermentative power, are separated
from the air by the aid of the lungs and introduced into the
mass of the blood. And so necessary for life of every kind
is that aereal salt (constituent) that not even plants can
grow in earth the access of air to which is shut off. But if
that same earth be exposed to air and so forthwith impregnated
with that fecundating salt, it at once becomes fit again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
for growing.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> Mayow fully appreciated the importance of
his nitro-aereal particles in the processes of life; he had indeed
a fairly accurate conception of a sound theory of animal
heat; he saw that they were equally necessary for burning,
or combustion, and for respiration, and so was enabled to
draw a parallelism between the two processes; he pointed
out that they were essential for the ordinary activity of the
muscles of the body, that as muscle work was increased more
particles from the air were required; indeed, he clearly foresaw
the need which the body had for these igneo-aereal particles
in all the chemical processes of life. And thus was
foreshadowed a conception of oxidation, a hundred years before
Priestley evolved his phlogiston theories and Lavoisier
discovered oxygen.</p>

<p>The discoveries of Lavoisier, published in 1789, led to a
clear understanding of combustion as a process of oxidation,
and paved the way for a fuller knowledge of the part played
by the oxygen of the air in the chemical reactions going on in
the animal body. Lavoisier showed that the oxygen drawn
into the lungs with the air breathed was used in the body for
the oxidation of certain substances, carbon being transformed
thereby into carbon dioxide, and hydrogen into water. Further,
he noted that these oxidations were carried forward on
a large scale, and he emphasized the importance of oxygen
as being the true cause of the varied decompositions taking
place in the living body. The larger the amount of oxygen
inspired, the more extensive the oxidation, and consequently
the rate of respiration as modifying the intake of oxygen
served in his opinion as a regulator to control the extent of
the oxidative processes. He pointed out that a definite relationship
existed between the amount of work done by the
body and the oxygen consumed; greater muscular activity,
lower temperature of the surrounding air, the activities attending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
the digestive functions, all seemed to be associated
with a greater utilization of oxygen. Oxidation was the
pivot around which all the chemical reactions of the body
seemed to centre. Lavoisier, however, was not a physiologist,
and he was, quite naturally perhaps, led into some errors.
For example, he considered that the process of combustion
or oxidation took place in the lungs, certain fluids rich in
carbon and hydrogen formed in the different organs of the
body being brought there for exposure to the inspired oxygen.
Further, his views implied a simple and complete combustion,
in which complex substances rich in carbon were
directly and completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water,
in much the same manner as combustion occurs outside the
body. Again, he assumed that the amount of oxygen taken
into the lungs determined the extent of oxidation, just as the
use of the bellows, by increasing the draft of air, causes the
fire to burn more brightly.</p>

<p>To Liebig (1842) the next great advance was due. This
phenomenally clear-minded man, while recognizing at their
full value the fundamental theories advanced by Lavoisier,
saw and fully appreciated their incompleteness, and he likewise
understood their failure to explain many of the phenomena
of life more familiar to the physiological mind than
to that of a simple chemist like Lavoisier. Liebig had made
a special study of the chemical composition of foodstuffs, and
likewise of the tissues and organs of the body. He had,
moreover, given great attention to the decomposition products
formed in the body, especially the nitrogenous substances excreted
through the kidneys, as well as the carbon dioxide and
water passed out through the lungs and skin. It was not
strange, therefore, that he should take exception to Lavoisier’s
view that oxidation in the body consisted in the combustion
of a fluid, rich in carbon and hydrogen, which was
brought to the lungs. On the contrary, Liebig contended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
that it was the organic compounds, proteids, fats, and carbohydrates,
that underwent oxidation, and not necessarily in
the lungs, but all over the body, wherever organs and tissues
were active. Especially noteworthy was the view advanced
by Liebig, and upheld for many years, that of these three
classes of compounds the proteids alone served for the construction
of organized tissues, like muscle, and that in the
activity of this tissue, as in muscle contraction or muscle
work, the energy for the work was derived solely from the
breaking down or oxidation of this organized proteid. On
this ground he termed the proteid foodstuffs “plastic,” or
tissue-building foods. Liebig further pointed out that the
substances of the body have the power of combining with and
holding on to the inspired oxygen, and that fats and carbohydrates,
<i>i. e.</i>, the non-nitrogenous compounds, easily undergo
oxidation or combustion, and thereby furnish the heat
of the body. For this reason he termed the corresponding
foodstuffs “respiratory” foods. Proteids, on the other hand,
according to Liebig’s view, are capable of combustion only
in slight degree. The cause of the decomposition of proteid
substances in the body was to be traced solely to muscle
work, <i>i. e.</i>, the energy of muscle contraction, or muscle work,
was derived from the breaking down of the proteids of the
muscle tissue, and work was the stimulus which brought
about proteid decomposition. Non-nitrogenous substances
played no part in these reactions; muscle work was without
influence on these compounds, oxygen being the sole stimulus
which led to their combustion, and heat was the sole product
of the combustion.</p>

<p>If Liebig’s theory is correct, that the proteids of the body
are decomposed only as the result or the accompaniment of
muscle work, and the proteids of the food are used up only
as they take the place of the organized proteid so metabolized,
it follows that with a like degree of muscular activity a given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
body will always decompose the same amount of proteid. If
excess of proteid food is taken, the surplus will be stored in
the tissues, or, in other words, the excretion of nitrogen will
not be influenced by the amount of proteid consumed in the
food. This was the line of argument made use of by various
<span class="nowrap">physiologists<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> who were disposed to criticise Liebig’s view,
and quite naturally the question was soon made the subject
of many experiments. It will suffice here merely to say that
many concordant results were obtained, showing that an
abundance of proteid food leads to an increase in the excretion
of nitrogen, muscle activity remaining at a constant
level. Hence, as Voit states, some other ground than muscle
work must be sought as the true cause of proteid katabolism.
Consequently, we find this hypothesis of Liebig replaced by
the theory of “luxus consumption,” in which it is maintained
that while whatever proteid is used up by the work of the
muscle must be made good from the proteid of the food, any
excess of proteid absorbed from the intestinal canal is to be
considered as “luxus,” and like the non-nitrogenous foods
may be burned up in the blood, by the oxygen therein, without
being previously organized. Hence, we see suggested
two causes for the decomposition of proteid in the body, viz.,
the work of the muscle and the oxygen of the blood. Further,
as stated by C Voit<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> the nitrogen excretion of the
hungry or fasting animal affords, according to these views,
a measure of the extent to which tissue proteid must be
broken down in the maintenance of life, and of the amount
of proteid food necessary to be consumed in order to make
good the loss; viz., the minimum proteid requirement.
Again, since any excess of proteid food beyond this minimal
requirement, according to the theory, is destined to be burned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
up in the blood, or elsewhere, to furnish heat the same as non-nitrogenous
foods, it follows that the excess of proteid food
can be replaced by non-nitrogenous aliment.</p>

<p>Oxidation, however, is the keynote in any explanation of
the processes of metabolism, whether nitrogenous or non-nitrogenous
matter is involved. Both alike undergo oxidation,
but it is not simple oxidation or combustion that we
have to deal with. In the time of Lavoisier, as already
stated, it was thought that oxygen alone was the cause of
the decomposition going on in the body, but simply increasing
the intake of air or oxygen, as in quickened breathing
or deeper inspiration, does not increase correspondingly the
rate of oxidation. In other words, it is not a direct combination
of oxygen with the carbon and hydrogen of the
foodstuffs, or tissue elements, that takes place in the body,
but rather a gradual, progressive decomposition of complex
organic compounds into simpler products; made possible,
however, by the agency of the oxygen carried from the lungs
by the circulating blood. It was demonstrated years ago that
animals breathing pure oxygen do not consume any more of
the gas than when breathing ordinary air, and likewise no
more carbon dioxide is produced in the one case than in
the other. Fifty years ago, Liebig and other physiologists
showed that frogs’ muscle placed in an atmosphere free of
oxygen could be made to contract or do work for some
considerable time, and with liberation of heat. This fact
implies a breaking down of muscle substance into simpler
bodies, but there is here no free oxygen to act as the inciting
cause; indeed, what actually occurs is a cleavage or splitting
up of substances in the muscle tissue, but at the expense of
oxygen in some form of combination in the muscle. This
oxygen must have been taken from the blood at some previous
time and stored in the tissue for future use. Again,
as C Voit has expressed it, if oxygen were really the immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
cause of the decompositions taking place in the organism,
we should expect combustion to occur in harmony with
the well-known relationship of the three classes of organic
foodstuffs to oxygen. In other words, fats would undergo
combustion most readily, carbohydrates next, and lastly the
nitrogenous or albuminous compounds. In reality, however,
proteid matter is decomposed in largest quantity; a generous
addition of proteid food is always accompanied by an increased
consumption of oxygen. Yet oxygen is not the
inciting cause of the proteid decomposition, as is seen from
the fact that in muscle work, where the intake of oxygen is
greatly increased, there is no noticeable change in the amount
of proteid material broken down. Plainly, in the body we
have to deal not with a direct oxidation of the complex compounds
of the tissues or of the food, but rather with a gradual
cleavage of these higher compounds into simpler substances,
these latter undergoing progressively a still further breaking
down with intake of oxygen. To repeat, oxygen is not the
<i>cause</i> of the decompositions within the body, but the extent of
the breaking down of the tissue or food material is the determining
factor in the amount of oxygen taken on and used up.
The products of decomposition contain more oxygen than the
original substances undergoing the breaking down process,
which means that oxygen is taken from the blood and used
in the physiological combustion that is going on. It is not,
however, strictly a combustion process; it is more complicated
and more gradual than ordinary combustion, involving
first of all a series of what may be termed oxidative cleavages,
in which large molecules are gradually, step by step, broken
down into simpler molecules, and these latter then oxidized
to still simpler forms. Hence, we find the oxidative changes
preceded by a variety of alterations in which oxygen may
take no part whatever; such as hydrolytic cleavage, where
the elements of water are taken on as a necessary step in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
cleavage process; dissociation of a simple sort, as when a
large molecule breaks up directly into smaller molecules, etc.</p>

<p>These statements by no means detract from the importance
of oxygen in the katabolic processes of the body, but it is
physiological oxidation that we have to do with, and not
simple combustion. Oxygen is not the direct cause of the
transformations taking place in the body. As one looks
over the history of progress in our knowledge of nutrition
from the time of Lavoisier to the present, it is easy to note
the gradual change of view regarding oxidation in the living
organism. Step by step, it has been demonstrated that there
are many factors involved in this breaking down of complex
substances; that while oxygen is an ever present requirement,
there are other equally important factors to be taken
into account. The contrast between the older views and
those now current is clearly shown by the difference in attitude
regarding the <i>place</i> in the body where oxidation occurs.
Thus, in the earlier days, when the view was gradually gaining
ground that nutritional changes were mainly the result
of oxidation, and that the oxygen drawn into the lungs in
inspiration was a primary factor, then, as we have seen, the
lungs were considered as the laboratory where the transformation
takes place. This view, however, was soon exploded,
and next we find the blood, the lymph, and other fluids, but
especially the blood, looked on as the locality where oxidation
occurs. This was indeed quite a natural view to hold, since
the blood is the carrier of oxygen, but we now know, in harmony
with the fact that the breaking down of complex food
material is a complicated process, involving various kinds of
chemical change, that these katabolic processes are not located
in any one place, but occur all over the body wherever there
are active tissues. As has been previously stated, the human
body is a “nation” of cells, all of which are more or less
active, and it is in these miniature laboratories mainly that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
oxidation and all the other nutritional changes coincident to
life take place. Muscle tissue and nerve tissue, the large
secreting glands, such as the liver, stomach, and pancreas,
all are the seat of oxidative and other changes which we
class under the broad term of nutritional. To these cells,
therefore, we must look for an explanation of the causes of
oxidation, and the other transformations of a kindred nature
that take place in the body.</p>

<p>In our brief survey of digestion, and of the methods there
followed for the proper utilization of the organic foodstuffs,
it was seen that the unorganized ferments or enzymes are the
active agents in accomplishing the breaking down of proteids,
and the less profound alteration of fats and carbohydrates.
Is it not possible that the tissues of the body are likewise
supplied with enzymes of various types, and that upon these
powerful agents rests the responsibility for the different
kinds of decomposition, oxidation and other changes, that
take place in the body? Some years ago much interest was
aroused by the observation that certain glands in the body,
if simply warmed at body temperature with water, in the
presence of some germicidal agent sufficient to prevent putrefactive
changes, underwent what is now termed autodigestion,
<i>i. e.</i>, a process of self-digestion, with formation of various
products, notably such as would naturally result from the
breaking down of proteid material by ordinary proteolytic
enzymes. This would seem to imply the presence in the
glands of a proteid-splitting enzyme, the products formed
being proteoses, peptones, amino-acids, etc., just such products
as result from the action of trypsin. To-day, we know that
practically all tissues and organs can, under suitable conditions,
undergo autolysis, and in many instances the enzymes
themselves can be separated from the tissues by appropriate
treatment. Liver, muscle, lymph glands, spleen, kidneys,
lungs, thymus, etc., all contain what are very appropriately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
called intracellular enzymes. These enzymes are of various
kinds. Especially conspicuous are the hydrolytic, proteid-splitting
enzymes, which behave in a manner quite similar
to, if not identical with, that of the digestive enzymes of
the gastro-intestinal tract, <i>i. e.</i>, pepsin, trypsin, and erepsin.
Further, there are other hydrolytic cleavages taking place in
tissue cells, such as the cleavage of fats, due as we now know
to intracellular enzymes of the lipase type, and by which
neutral fats are split apart into glycerin and fatty acid.
Again, there are in many organs intracellular enzymes which
act upon the complex nucleoproteids of the tissue, causing
them to break apart into proteid and nucleic acid, the latter
being further broken down by other enzymes with liberation
of the contained nuclein or purin bases. Many other chemical
reactions are brought about by specific enzymes of various
kinds, present in the cells of particular glandular organs.
Thus, intracellular enzymes have been found, as in the liver,
which are able to transform amino-acids into amides, and still
others capable of splitting up amides.</p>

<p>Equally important, and even more suggestive, are the data
which have been collected recently regarding oxidative processes
in the tissues of the body. Specific ferments, known
as oxidases, are found widely distributed in many organs and
tissues, and it is difficult to escape the conclusion that as intracellular
enzymes they have an important part to play in
some, at least, of the transformations characteristic of tissue
katabolism<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> As a single example, mention may be made of
aldehydase, which accomplishes the oxidation of substances
having the structure of aldehydes into corresponding acids.
Ferments or enzymes of this class are found in the liver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
spleen, salivary glands, lungs, brain, kidneys, etc., and they
may well be considered as important agents in the chemical
transformations going on in the tissues of the body. It would
take us too far afield to enter into a detailed consideration of
these intracellular enzymes; it must suffice to emphasize the
general fact that in all the tissues and organs of the body there
are present a large number of enzymes of different types, endowed
with different lines of activity, and consequently capable
of accomplishing a great variety of results in metabolism.
Oxidation may still be a dominant feature in nutrition, oxidative
changes may characterize more or less every tissue and
organ in the body, but the processes are subtle and are not to
be defined in harmony with simple chemical or physical laws.
The living cell, with its intracellular enzymes, is the guiding
and controlling power by which the processes of katabolism are
regulated in harmony with the needs of the body. Complex
organic matter is broken down step by step in the various
tissues, with gradual liberation of the contained energy;
processes of hydrolytic cleavage alternate with processes of
oxidation, the molecules acted upon growing smaller with
each downward step, until at last the final end-products are
reached, viz., carbon dioxide, water, and urea, which the
body eliminates through various channels as true physiological
waste-products.</p>

<p>It will be advisable for us to consider briefly some of these
intermediary products of tissue metabolism, since in any discussion
of nutritive changes it is quite essential to have some
understanding of the chemical relationship existing between
the various products which result from the breaking down
of proteid and other materials in tissue katabolism. This is
especially true of proteid material, since in the gradual disintegration
of this substance in tissue metabolism many intermediary
bodies are formed, which undoubtedly exercise
some physiological influence prior to their transformation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
into simpler bodies, with ultimate formation of the final
product, urea. As has been pointed out so many times, the
proteid foods are peculiar in that they alone contain the necessary
nitrogen, and in the peculiar form able to meet the
physiological requirements of the body. Variations in the
proteid intake are of necessity accompanied by variations in
the formation of nitrogenous intermediary products, and both
quality and quantity of these substances must be given due
attention in any study of nutrition. Further, it is only by
an understanding of the general or ground structure of proteids
that we can hope to attain knowledge of the processes
going on in the different tissues and organs in connection
with metabolism, while a true appreciation of the chemical
peculiarities of the individual proteids will help to explain the
different nutritional value of vegetable as contrasted with
animal proteids.</p>

<p>Our understanding of the chemical structure of any organic
substance is based primarily upon a study of the decomposition
products which result from its breaking down,
under the influence of various chemical agencies. Simple
proteid substances when acted upon by pancreatic juice reinforced
by the enzyme erepsin, or when boiled with dilute
acids, undergo hydrolytic cleavage with ultimate formation of
a large number of relatively simple bodies, mostly amino-acids,
the chemical structure of which throws some light
upon the nature of the proteid. Thus, in the pancreatic
digestion of proteid in the intestine we may adopt the following
scheme as showing in a general way the progressive
transformation that occurs, understanding at the same time
that like transformations may be accomplished by corresponding
intracellular enzymes in the tissues and organs of
the body; and further, that by the long-continued action of
hydrolytic agents there is a complete breaking down into
amino-acids and other simple products.</p>

<p>Among these end-products, or amino-acids, are leucin,
tyrosin, aspartic acid, glutaminic acid, glycocoll, arginin,
lysin, histidin, and likewise the peculiar aromatic body tryptophan.
The chemical make-up of these substances may be
indicated by the following structural formulæ, which, if even
only partially understood, will suggest to the non-chemical
mind some idea of close chemical relationship:</p>

</div>

<p>In these various decomposition products there is apparent
certain definite lines of resemblance, on which is based one
or more suggestions regarding possible ways in which these
chemical groups are linked, or bound together, in the proteid
molecule. Thus, there is apparently present a complex or
nucleus which may be indicated as</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i-68b" style="max-width: 30.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-68b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The proteid molecule is presumably built up of amino-acids
variously joined together, this synthesis being accomplished,
doubtless, by the condensation of different types of
amino-acids, in which the first of the above groups represents
the more common method of union. We may indeed conjecture
that such methods of condensation take place in the
human body, in the epithelial cells of the intestine, and in the
tissues in general; and that by such methods, construction of
proteid is accomplished out of the various fragments split off
by digestion, etc. In a tentative way, the principle may be
illustrated by the fusion of leucin and glutaminic acid,&mdash;following
Hofmeister’s suggestion,&mdash;in which a still larger
complex is formed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i-69" style="max-width: 27.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-69.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="ilb">               Leucin                             Glutaminic&nbsp;acid&emsp;&emsp;</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In this way, step by step, the proteid molecule is built up,
and naturally in katabolism the proteid breaks down along
certain definite lines of cleavage, with formation of katabolic
products containing those groups, or chemical nuclei, which
characterize the different proteid molecules. For it is to be
clearly understood that there are many different forms of
proteid, perhaps superficially alike, but possessed of physiological
individuality. This is well illustrated by the two
primary proteoses formed in digestion. As will be recalled,
there are at first two proteoses produced, protoproteose and
heteroproteose. These are, superficially at least, not radically
unlike; they possess essentially the same percentage
composition, but when broken down by vigorous chemical
methods they show a totally different make-up. In other
words, at the very beginning of digestion there is a splitting
up of the proteid into two parts, which have quite a different
chemical structure, as is clearly indicated by the difference in
the character and amount of the decomposition products
yielded by hydrolytic cleavage. Thus, heteroalbumose as
derived from blood-fibrin contains 39 per cent of its total
nitrogen in basic form, <i>i. e.</i>, in a form which goes over into
the basic bodies, arginin, lysin, and histidin, etc. On the
other hand, protoalbumose from the same source yields hardly
25 per cent of basic nitrogen. Further, heteroalbumose yields
only a very small amount of tyrosin, while protoalbumose
gives on decomposition a large amount of this substance.
Again, heteroalbumose furnishes a large yield of leucin
and glycocoll, while protoalbumose gives no glycocoll and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
only a little leucin. Obviously, these two proteoses have
an inner structure quite divergent one from the other, and
owing to this fact they must play a quite different rôle in
metabolism.</p>

<p>Even greater differences in inner chemical structure are
found among native proteids. By way of illustration, we
may take egg-albumin, the casein of cow’s milk, gliadin of
wheat, and the edestin of hemp seed. These are all typical
proteids; they are all useful as food, but they are radically
different in their inner chemical structure, as is clearly indicated
by the following data<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> which show the percentage
yield of the different amino-acids and ammonia:</p>

<p>These are not mere technical differences, but they represent
divergences of structure which cannot help counting as
material factors in nutritional processes. Especially noticeable
is the large yield of glutaminic acid from wheat proteid,
as contrasted with the proteid (casein) of animal origin. As a
rule, glutaminic acid forms a larger proportion of the decomposition
products of vegetable than of animal proteids. Similarly,
arginin is present in much larger proportion in most
vegetable proteids than in most animal proteids. While
many other data more or less trustworthy might be added,
these figures will suffice to emphasize the main point under
discussion, viz., that individual proteids show marked variation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
in the amount of the several amino-acids which serve as
corner-stones or nuclei in the building up of the molecule,
and consequently they must yield correspondingly different
katabolic products when serving the body as food.</p>

<p>Turning now to another phase of tissue metabolism, we
may consider briefly the nucleoproteids and their characteristic
decomposition products; bodies which are widely distributed
as cleavage products formed in the disintegration of
most cell protoplasm, and having special interest in nutrition
because of their chemical relationship to that well-known
substance, uric acid. Nucleoproteids of some type are found
in all cells; consequently they are present in all tissues, in
all glandular organs, and their widespread distribution constitutes
evidence of their great physiological importance.
Nucleoproteids are compound substances made up of some
form of proteid and nucleic acid. By simple hydrolysis with
dilute mineral acids they are broken down into proteid,
phosphoric acid, and one or more bodies known as nuclein
bases. Of these latter substances, there are four well-defined
bodies, viz., adenin, hypoxanthin, guanin, and xanthin, which
from their peculiar chemical constitution are known as “purin
bases.” In the body, there is present in many cells a peculiar
intracellular enzyme termed <i>nuclease</i>, which has the power
of liberating these purin bases from their combination as a
component part of tissue nucleoproteids, or of the contained
nucleic acid. In autolysis or self-digestion of many glands,
such as the spleen, thymus, etc., this chemical reaction is
easily induced by action of the contained nuclease. Further,
the liberated purin bases then undergo change because of
the presence of certain deamidizing enzymes, and as a result
guanin is transformed into xanthin, and adenin is converted
into hypoxanthin. These ferments are true intracellular
enzymes, and are termed respectively <i>guanase</i> and <i>adenase</i>.
The real essence of the reaction they accomplish is clearly indicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
by the following formulæ, which likewise show the
chemical nature and relationship of the four substances:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i-72a" style="max-width: 32.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-72a.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="ilb">Guanin                                                             Xanthin&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</span></p></div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i-72b.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="ilb">Adenin                                                             Hypoxanthin&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>These two enzymes are typical hydrolyzing enzymes, but
it is to be noted that there is not only a taking on of water
with a retention of the oxygen, but there is also a giving off
of ammonia, by which the transformation is made possible.
Adenin is known as an amino-purin and guanin as an amino-oxypurin,
while hypoxanthin is an oxypurin and xanthin a
dioxypurin. In other words, the two intracellular enzymes
are able to transform the two amino-purins into the corresponding
oxypurins; <i>i. e.</i>, the enzymes are deamidizing ferments,
liberating the NH<sub>2</sub> group of the adenin and guanin
and thus forming two new compounds. These reactions,
though more or less technical, are emphasized in this way not
merely because they illustrate the action of intracellular
enzymes in intermediary metabolism, thus affording a striking
example of the gradual changes that take place in ordinary
katabolic processes, but especially because they throw light
upon the production of another substance common in body
metabolism, viz., uric acid. It has long been known that
nucleoproteids, nucleins, and other compounds containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
these purin radicles, when taken as food, cause at once an
increased output of uric acid, and it has been clearly recognized
that in some way this latter substance, as a product of
metabolism, must come from the transformation of nuclein
bases. To-day, we understand that in many tissues, as in the
liver, spleen, lungs, and muscle, there is present a peculiar
oxidizing ferment, an oxidase, by the action of which hypoxanthin
can be converted into xanthin, and the latter directly
oxidized to uric acid. This conversion into uric acid is purely
a process of oxidation, brought about by a typical intracellular
oxidase, known specifically as “xanthin oxidase,” the reaction
involved being as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i-73a" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-73a.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="ilb">Xanthin                                                              Uric&nbsp;acid</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>From these several reactions, it is clear how various intracellular
enzymes working one after the other are able
gradually to evolve uric acid from tissue nucleoproteids.
Further, it is to be noted that there is another tissue oxidase&mdash;contained
principally in the kidneys, muscle, and liver&mdash;which
has the power of oxidizing and thus destroying uric
acid, with formation, among other substances, of urea. Remembering
that urea has the following chemical constitution</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp87" id="i-73b" style="max-width: 5.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-73b.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>it is easy to see, by comparison of the formulæ, how uric acid
might easily yield two molecules of urea through simple
oxidation. In this way, excess of uric acid produced in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
body can be converted into urea, and in this harmless form
be excreted from the system.</p>

<p>Finally, reference should be made here to several other
products of tissue metabolism, products of the breaking down
of proteid matter in the body, since they are liable to prove of
interest to us in other connections. Thus creatin, abundant in
the muscle and other places; the related substance creatinin,
present in the urine; methyl guanidin, a decomposition product
of creatin; and urea, all call for a word of description.
The chemical relationship of these bodies is clearly indicated
by the following formulæ:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i-74a1" style="max-width: 23.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-74a1.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>Creatin&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Creatinin&emsp;</p></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i-74a2" style="max-width: 23.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-74a2.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="ilb">Methyl&nbsp;guanidin                             Urea&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Creatinin is chemically the anhydride of creatin, <i>i. e.</i>, it can
be formed from creatin by the simple extraction of one molecule
of water, H<sub>2</sub>O. Creatin, by hydrolytic cleavage, will
break down into one molecule of urea and one molecule of
sarcosin or methyl glycocoll, as shown in the following
equation:</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i-74b" style="max-width: 31em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-74b.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="ilb">              Creatin                                                Sarcosin                                    Urea</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Methyl guanidin is a decomposition product of creatin, while
guanidin, as can be seen from the formula, is like urea, excepting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
that the group NH replaces the oxygen of urea.
These simple statements will suffice for our present purpose,
viz., to indicate the more or less close chemical relationships
existing between many of these nitrogenous decomposition
products resulting from proteid katabolism; also to suggest
how by slight chemical alteration one decomposition product
may be resolved into another related substance in the processes
of katabolism. Our conception of the processes involved
in proteid katabolism is that of a series of progressive
chemical decompositions, in which intracellular enzymes play
the all-important part. The intermediary products formed
are definite bodies because of the specific nature of the active
enzymes, and, secondly, because of the chemical nature of
the substances acted upon. In other words, oxidation in
the animal body takes the shape of a series of well-defined
chemical reactions, in which chemical constitution and specific
enzyme action are the predetermining cause. In the absence
of the particular chemical groups, the oxidase is unable to
bring about oxidation, or, given the proper compound or
mother substance in the absence of the specific oxidase, there
is no oxidation. Hence, oxidation in the animal body is not
the result of simple combustion, but, on the contrary, it consists
of a series of orderly chemical processes, each one of
which is presided over by an intracellular enzyme, specific in
its nature, in that it is capable of acting only upon substances
having a certain definite constitution, and leading invariably
to a certain definite result. The processes which years ago
were considered as due to the peculiar vital properties of the
tissue cells, and which were supposed to be entirely dependent
upon their morphological and functional integrity,
are now seen to be due primarily to a great variety of
enzymes, manufactured indeed by the living cells, but capable
of manifesting their activity even when free from the
influence of the living protoplasm. The varied processes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
tissue katabolism are the result of orderly and progressive
chemical changes, in which cleavage, hydrolysis, reduction,
oxidation, deamidization, etc., alternate with each other
under the influence of specific enzymes, where chemical constitution
and the structural make-up of the various molecules
are determining factors in the changes produced.</p>

<p>Man, strictly speaking, is always in a condition of
unequilibrium. If placed upon a large and sensitive
pair of scales with the opposite side exactly counterpoised,
he will be found to lose weight constantly until water
or food are taken, when the losses of an hour or two may be
made good, or perchance more than balanced. The human
body is a maelstrom of chemical changes; chemical decompositions
are taking place continuously at the expense of the
proteids, fats, and carbohydrates of the tissues and of the
food, the stored-up energy of these organic compounds being
thereby transformed into the active or “kinetic” forms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
heat and motion; while carbon dioxide, water, urea, and
some few other nitrogenous substances are being continually
formed as the normal waste products of these tissue changes,
and constantly or intermittently excreted. In other words,
the body is in a perpetual condition of chemical oscillation,
constantly consuming its own substance, rejecting the waste
products which result, and giving off energy in the several
forms characteristic of living beings. The condition of the
body plainly depends upon the relation which it is able to
maintain between the income and the expenditure of matter
and energy. If the income equals the output, the body is
kept in a condition approaching equilibrium; if the intake
exceeds the outgo, the body adds to its capital of matter and
energy; while if the expenditure is greater than the income,
the accumulated capital is drawn upon; and this, if continued
indefinitely, results in a drain upon the bank which must
eventually end in disaster. It is comparatively easy, however,
for man to maintain his body in a condition of equilibrium
from day to day; <i>i. e.</i>, the losses of the morning can
be made good at luncheon, or the expenditures of an entire
day counterbalanced by a corresponding addition to capital
the following day, in which case the body may be said to be
in balance. It is necessary, however, to discriminate between
body equilibrium, meaning thereby the maintenance from day
to day of a constant body-weight, and nitrogen equilibrium,
or carbon equilibrium. In the latter cases, what is meant is
that the intake of nitrogen, or of carbon, exactly equals the
output of these two elements. It is quite possible, however,
to have a condition of nitrogen equilibrium without the body
being in a state of balance, as when the outgo of carbon
exceeds the intake of carbon, or when there is an increased
output of water.</p>

<p>As a rule, it may be stated that when a man puts out less
carbon and less nitrogen than he takes in he must be gaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
in weight; the only exception being the possible case of an
increased excretion of water, which might more than counterbalance
the gain. On the other hand, if he gives off more
carbon and more nitrogen than he takes in, the body must
lose in weight. Where the output of carbon is beyond the
amount of carbon ingested, the lost carbon represents a drain
upon body fat. In a reversal of this condition, <i>i. e.</i>, where
the carbon taken in is in excess of the outgo, the body is
gaining in fat. Theoretically, gain or loss of carbon may
mean gain or loss of either carbohydrate or fat, but practically
stored-up carbon generally stands for accumulated fat; and,
correspondingly, loss of carbon represents a withdrawal from
the store of adipose tissue, since glycogen and sugar from a
quantitative standpoint figure only slightly in these metabolic
processes. When the body excretes more nitrogen than is
taken in during a given period, there is only one interpretation
possible, viz., that the body is losing proteid or flesh.
If, on the other hand, the nitrogen import exceeds the outgo,
then the body must be gaining flesh. Here, again, there is
the theoretical possibility that gain or loss of nitrogen might
represent increase or decrease of proteid in some glandular
organ, or even in the blood; but practically it is the relatively
bulky muscle tissue, with its high content of proteid matter,
that is most subject to change in metabolism. Finally, it is
easy to see how, knowing the percentage of nitrogen in proteid
and the percentage of carbon in fat, one can calculate
from the nitrogen and carbon lost or gained the amounts of
proteid or fat added to the capital stock, or withdrawn from
the store of nutritive material.</p>

<p>When there is no income, as in fasting, the body loses
rapidly, living during the hunger period upon its store of
energy-containing material. Many careful observations have
been made upon people who have fasted for long periods,
some as long as thirty days, the income consisting solely of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
water. The following <span class="nowrap">figures<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> show the daily excretion of

<p>In Succi’s case, the fasting was continued for thirty days.
The daily average loss of nitrogen from the 11th to the 15th
day was 5.8 grams; from the 16th to the 20th day, 5.3 grams;
from the 20th to the 25th day, 4.7 grams; and from the 26th
to the 30th day, 5.3 grams. A daily loss of 5.3 grams of
nitrogen means a breaking down, or using up, of 33 grams of
proteid, or a little more than one ounce. On the sixth day
of fasting, all three of these subjects showed essentially the
same daily loss of nitrogen; viz., 10 grams, which implies a
using up of 62.5 grams of proteid material. We must not
be led astray by these figures, however, or draw too hasty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
conclusions therefrom regarding the requirements of the body
for proteid food. Noting the close agreement in the nitrogen
output of the three subjects on the sixth day, combined with
the fact that their body-weight was essentially the same, we
might infer that 62.5 grams of proteid matter represents the
amount of nitrogenous food necessary to maintain nitrogen
equilibrium and keep the body in a condition of balance.
Such a conclusion, however, would be quite erroneous for
several reasons. First, a man fasting, if he was in an ordinary
condition of nutrition prior to the fast, has in his tissues
a large store of fat. It is considered that in fasting only
about 10–12 per cent of the total energy of the body is derived
from tissue proteid; the major part comes from the fat
stored up. When there is no income to make good the loss,
the body must naturally draw upon its own store. A certain
amount of proteid must be used up daily, but in addition
there are the energy requirements to be considered. These
are met mainly by fat and carbohydrate, and so long as fat
endures proteid will be drawn upon only, or mainly, to meet
the nitrogen requirement; but if the fat gives out, then proteid
must be used in larger quantity, as a source of energy.
Hence in fasting, the daily loss of nitrogen will be governed
largely by the condition of the body as regards fat. Thus,
Munk has reported the case of a well-nourished and fat person,
suffering from disease of the brain, who gave off daily in
the later stages of starvation only one-third the amount of
nitrogen voided by Cetti, who had been poorly nourished.
Obviously, in fasting, as soon as the adipose tissue of the body
has been largely used up, there will be an increase in the
amount of tissue proteid consumed, since under such conditions
the heat of the body and the energy of muscular work
(work of the heart and involuntary muscles) must come from
the decomposition of proteid. In harmony with this statement,
it is frequently observed that in cases of starvation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
there comes toward the end a sudden and marked increase
in the output of nitrogen.</p>

<p>Secondly, the elimination of nitrogen during the earlier
days of fasting is governed in large measure by the character
and extent of the diet on the days just preceding the fast.
This is well illustrated by some experiments conducted by
C Voit on a dog. In the first series of experiments, the dog
received daily 2500 grams of meat prior to fasting; in the
second series, 1500 grams of meat were fed daily before the
fast; while in the third series, a mixed diet relatively poor in
proteid was given. The following <span class="nowrap">figures<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> show the amounts
of proteid used up by the dog (calculated from the nitrogen
excreted) each day of the fasting period, under the different
conditions:</p>

<p>We see very clearly in these experiments the effects of
the large quantities of proteid fed on the destruction of
proteid in the early days of fasting. When the body is rich
in proteid from food previously taken, the metabolism of nitrogenous
matter is very large at first, as in the first series
of experiments. Indeed, in this series, even on the fifth day of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
fasting, the amount of proteid metabolized was larger than
on the second day of the third series. We have here a forcible
illustration of the physiological axiom that excess of proteid
matter in the tissues, or in the blood, stimulates proteid
metabolism; and it affords convincing proof of the contention
that in the first days of fasting the output of nitrogen, or the
amount of proteid used up, will depend in large measure upon
the proteid condition of the body at the time of the fast.
Equally noticeable is the fact that there comes a time&mdash;the
sixth day in the above experiment&mdash;when the nitrogen output
reaches a common level, irrespective of the previous proteid
condition of the body. Further, it is easy to see that
the greater loss of nitrogen, <i>i. e.</i>, the large breaking down of
proteid during the first few days of fasting, in those cases
where proteid food has been freely taken, suggests the existence
in the tissues of two forms of proteid. We may term
them, following the nomenclature of Voit, as circulating and
morphotic, or tissue, proteid; or, we may designate them as
labile and stable forms of proteid. In other words, following
the usually accepted view, this circulating or labile proteid
represents reserve or surplus material which is easily
decomposed and hence rapidly gotten rid of, while the stable
proteid is more slowly oxidized, and its metabolism may be
taken as representing more nearly the real necessities of the
body. However this may be, it is plainly manifest that the
nitrogen output, meaning the metabolism of proteid matter,
during hunger or fasting is modified by a variety of circumstances,
notably the previous nutritive condition of the body
as regards both fat and proteid. It is hardly necessary to
add that the amount of muscular work performed is another
factor of importance in this connection. Fat in the body
represents inert material stored up mainly for nutritive purposes;
hence, in hunger it is used largely, and serves to protect
more important tissues. Thus, experiments have shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
that in long periods of fasting, adipose tissue may be consumed
to the extent of 97 per cent of the total amount present,
while the heart and nervous tissue will not lose over 3 per
cent of their tissue substance. The influence of tissue fat
upon the consumption of proteid during hunger can thus be
fully appreciated.</p>

<p>On the non-fasting days, the intake consisted of an ordinary
food mixture of proteids, fats, and carbohydrates, with
a small addition of alcohol. The point to be emphasized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
here, however, is that the carbon-content was more than
sufficient to meet the needs of the body. Thus, it will be
observed that on all three of the days when food was taken,
the income of carbon was far in excess of the output. In
other words, on the day preceding the beginning of the fast
the body stored up 135 grams of carbon, and on the day following
the fast the body retained 169 grams of carbon to
help make good the loss. Similarly, the amount of proteid
food taken in on the day prior to the fast was considerably
in excess of the needs of the body, 5.1 grams of nitrogen
equivalent to 31.8 grams of proteid being stored for future
use. Plainly, the man was not in either carbon or nitrogen
balance prior to the fast, but was taking far more food than
the needs of the body called for. This fact may be emphasized
by noting that the total fuel value of the daily food,
plus the fuel value of the alcohol, amounted on an average
to about 4200 large calories, while the fuel value of the
material metabolized on the feeding days averaged only 2500
calories. Looking at the figures showing the output of
carbon, as well as of nitrogen, during the fasting days, it is to
be seen that in the early days of fasting, the metabolism of
the body tends to remain at a fairly constant level, especially
when figured per kilogram of body-weight.</p>

<p>To fully appreciate what takes place in a man of the above
body-weight fasting for five days (though living on a large
excess of food prior to the fast), the daily losses of carbon
and nitrogen may be translated into terms of fat and proteid.
If it is assumed that the total carbon, aside from what necessarily
belongs to the proteid indicated by the nitrogen figures,
comes from the oxidation of fat, it is easy to compute the
amounts of fat and proteid metabolized, or destroyed, each
day of the fasting period. These are shown in the following
table:</p>

<p>These somewhat general statements, with the illustrations
given, will serve in a brief way to emphasize some of the
essential features of metabolism in the fasting individual;
where there is no income of energy-containing material, and
where the body must draw entirely upon its store of accumulated
fat and proteid to keep the machinery in motion, maintain
body temperature, and do the tasks of every-day life.
When it is remembered that persons have fasted for periods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
of thirty days or longer without succumbing, it is evident
that the body of the well-nourished man has a large reserve
of nutritive material, which can be drawn upon in cases of
emergency. At the same time, the facts presented show us
that in the early days of fasting the actual amounts of tissue
proteid and body fat consumed are not large. In Cetti’s
case, on the sixth day of fasting the metabolized nitrogen
amounted to 10 grams, which implies a loss of 62.5 grams of
proteid. At this rate of loss, one pound of dry proteid
matter in the form of tissue proteid would meet the wants
of a man of 130 pounds body-weight for seven and a half
days, provided of course there was a reasonable stock of fat
to help satisfy the energy requirements. Finally, we may
again emphasize the fact that the loss of nitrogen in the fasting
man is by no means a measure of the minimal proteid
requirement. By feeding fat, or carbohydrate, or both, the
output of nitrogen can be materially diminished, although
naturally we cannot establish a nitrogen balance by so doing,
since the income is free from nitrogen; but we can postpone
for a time the approach of nitrogen starvation.</p>

<p>We may next profitably consider the effect of a pure proteid
diet&mdash;such as lean meat free from fat&mdash;on the output
of nitrogen. In studying this problem, we at once meet with
several important and surprising facts. First, we are led to
see that, strange as it may seem, every addition of proteid
to the diet results in an increased excretion of nitrogen. In
other words, increase of proteid income is followed at once
by an increase in the metabolism of proteid, with a corresponding
outgo of nitrogen. The hungry or fasting man
with his income entirely cut off, and consequently suffering
from a heavy drain upon his capital stock, would be expected,
when suddenly supplied with fresh capital in the form of
meat or other kind of proteid food, to hold on firmly to this
all-important foodstuff; but such is not the case. It is impossible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
for example, to establish nitrogen equilibrium by
an income of proteid equal to what the individual during
fasting is found to metabolize. As stated by another, “It is
one of the cardinal laws of proteid metabolism that the store
of nitrogenous substances in the body is not increased by, or
not in proportion to, an increase in the nitrogen intake.”
The principle is well illustrated in the fasting experiment
just described. On the fifth day of fasting, the nitrogen output
amounted to 11.4 grams. On the day following, the man
took 35.6 grams of nitrogen in the form of proteid, while the
excretion of nitrogen for that day rose to 26.8 grams. In
other words, although deprived of all proteid income for five
days, and during that period drawing entirely upon his proteid
capital, the man was wholly unable to avail himself of the
proteid so abundantly supplied at the close of the fast and
make good the losses of the preceding days; only a small
proportion of the proteid income could be retained. If a dog
fed on a definite quantity of meat suddenly has his proteid
income increased, there is at once an acceleration of proteid
metabolism, and a corresponding increase in the output of
nitrogen. Addition of still more proteid to his income is
followed by an accumulation of a portion of the proteid; but
this tends to decrease gradually, while there is a corresponding
daily increase in the excretion of nitrogen. In this
manner, there finally results a condition of nitrogenous equilibrium
or nitrogen balance.</p>

<p>Again, an animal brought into nitrogen equilibrium by
excessive proteid feeding, if suddenly given a small amount
of meat per day, tends to put out nitrogen from its own
tissues. This tissue loss, however, decreases slowly, and
eventually the animal is quite likely to re-establish nitrogen
equilibrium at a lower level. There is, in other words,
a strong tendency for the body to pass into a condition
of nitrogen balance under different conditions of proteid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
feeding, even after a long period of nitrogen loss and with
an abundance of proteid in the intake. The starving body,
as we have seen, cannot make use of all the nitrogen fed,
although we can well conceive its great need for all the proteid
available. A certain amount of the proteid fed, or its
contained nitrogen, is at once passed out of the body and lost,
even though the organism be gasping, as it were, for proteid
to make good the drain incidental to long fasting. A recent
<span class="nowrap">writer<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> has suggested that some explanation for these anomalies
may be found in the supposition “that a long succession
of generations in the past, which have lived from choice or
necessity on a diet rich in proteids, have handed down to us,
as an inheritance, a constitution in which arrangements exist
for the removal of nitrogen from a considerable part of this
proteid. The fact that the amount of proteid taken is re-adjusted
to suit the actual needs of the body, though it
makes these arrangements unnecessary, will not necessarily
remove them. The denitrifying enzyme, which has been
trained to keep guard over the entrances by which nitrogenous
substances are admitted into the body, will continue
to levy its toll of nitrogen, even when the amount of proteid
presented to it is no more than the tissues which it serves
actually require.”</p>

<p>As an illustration of how the body behaves with a low
nitrogen intake followed by a sudden increase in the income
of proteid, some data from an experiment performed by
<span class="nowrap">Sivén<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> on himself may be cited:</p>

<p>I have ventured to give these data in some detail, because
of their exceeding great interest in several directions aside
from the point under discussion. Confining our attention to
the nitrogen exchange, it is to be observed that for a period
of two weeks Sivén lived on less than 3 grams of nitrogen
per day, and without any excessive intake of carbohydrate or
fat. During this time, the body naturally was in a condition
of minus balance as regards nitrogen, the output being considerably
larger than the income. The total amount of nitrogen
lost in the period, 31 grams, corresponds to a breaking
down of 193 grams of tissue proteid, or over one-third of a
pound. On increasing the income of nitrogen to 4 grams per
day, the nitrogen loss still continued, though at a much lower
rate; indeed, the body is seen to approach very closely to a
condition of nitrogen equilibrium. Still further increase of
the nitrogen income to 13 grams per day was followed at once
by a slight accumulation of proteid, and the body showed a
decided plus balance of nitrogen, as on November 27. This,
however, is seen to decrease gradually with a corresponding
daily increase in the outgo of nitrogen, until on December 2
the body was once more practically in nitrogenous equilibrium.
On again increasing the nitrogen income, to 23 grams per day,
the same process was repeated, although in this case the body
more quickly approached a condition of nitrogen balance.</p>

<p>We see in these data striking confirmation of the statement
that the nitrogen outgo tends to keep pace with the income
of nitrogen, the body always striving to maintain a condition
of nitrogen equilibrium. Consequently, the fasting man having
lost largely of his store of proteid can replace the latter
only slowly, even though he eats abundantly of proteid food.
Thus, Sivén in the week ending December 2, though taking
over 13 grams of nitrogen a day, retained in his body only 14.5
grams of nitrogen during the entire seven days; while in the
six days following, with a daily intake of 23 grams of nitrogen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
he gained only about 8 grams additional. The human
body does not readily store up proteid, and this is true no matter
how greatly the tissues are in need of replenishment.</p>

<p>If the daily income is reinforced by the addition of carbohydrate
or fat, there is observed a decided influence on the
outgo of nitrogen; the rate or extent of proteid metabolism
is at once modified, fat and carbohydrate both having a direct
saving effect on proteid. Neither fat nor carbohydrate can
prevent the katabolism of proteid, but they can and do decrease
it, and thus serve as proteid-sparers. In the fasting
body, or where there is only an intake of proteid, the latter
material, except for the fat contained in the tissues, must
serve the double purpose of meeting the specific nitrogen requirements
of the body and furnishing the requisite energy.
The energy requirements, however, can be met more advantageously
by either of the non-nitrogenous foodstuffs, and
just so far as they are oxidized, so far will there be a saving
of proteid. Herein lies the philosophy of a mixed diet, with
its natural intermingling of proteid, fat, and carbohydrate.
For the same reason, the body of a man rich in fat will in
fasting lose far less proteid per day than the lean man; or,
if fed with a given amount of proteid food, the fat man may
attain nitrogen equilibrium, or even store up a little proteid,
while on the same diet the lean man will lose proteid. Further,
if a man is in nitrogen balance with a given amount of
proteid food, the addition of fat or carbohydrate to the diet
will permit of a reduction in the amount of proteid necessary
to maintain nitrogenous equilibrium. Fat, however, when
added to food, does not always protect proteid to the extent
possibly suggested by the preceding statements. The following
data from oft-quoted experiments by <span class="nowrap">Voit<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> on dogs will
serve to illustrate:</p>

<p>It is to be observed that in both of these experiments the
fairly large addition of fat results in a saving of proteid, but
the sparing effect in the first experiment amounts to only 38
grams of proteid for the 150 grams of fat added. In the
second experiment, however, there is a saving of 36 grams of
proteid, although only 100 grams of fat were fed. The radical
point of difference in the two experiments is the amount
of proteid ingested. Proteid food stimulates proteid metabolism;
it likewise accelerates the metabolism of non-nitrogenous
matter, consequently the sparing or protecting effect of
fat on proteid is most conspicuous when the intake of proteid
is relatively small. Only under such conditions, does fat
protect in large degree the consumption of proteid in the
body. In the ordinary, daily, dietary of man, with its great
variety of food materials and with its proteid-content not
exceeding 125 grams, fat is apt to be a conspicuous element,
and under such conditions its sparing effect on proteid metabolism
is most marked. Further, it must not be forgotten,
as Voit originally pointed out, that the adipose tissue of the
body acts like the food-fat, and consequently the proteid-sparing
effect of the former may be added to that of the
latter.</p>

<p>The addition of carbohydrate to a meat diet produces at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
once a saving in the decomposition of proteid, as shown in
the following figures, covering an experiment of two days:</p>

<p>Without the sugar, there was a minus balance of 64 grams
of proteid, but addition of the carbohydrate caused practically
a saving of all of this, with establishment of essentially
a nitrogen balance. The sparing of proteid by carbohydrate
is greater than by fats, a fact of considerable dietetic importance
which is well illustrated by the following experiments
(on dogs) taken from Voit:</p>

<p>In considering the results of this experiment, it must be
remembered that the calorific or fuel value of fat as compared
with carbohydrate is as 9.3&nbsp;:&nbsp;4.1; in other words, fats have
a fuel value of more than twice that of carbohydrates. In
spite of this fact, it is clearly evident that carbohydrates as
a class&mdash;for the different sugars and starches act alike in
this respect&mdash;are far more efficient than fats in saving proteid.
Thus, with an income of 500 grams of meat and 250<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
grams of fat, the body of the animal lost 58 grams of proteid,
while with a like amount of meat and 300 grams of sugar the
body not only saved the 58 grams, but in addition stored 34
grams of proteid, showing a plus balance to that extent. The
sparing of proteid by carbohydrate amounts on an average,
according to Voit, to 9 per cent&mdash;in the highest cases to 15
per cent&mdash;of the proteid given, while the saving produced
by fat averages only 7 per cent. Further, increasing quantities
of carbohydrates in the food diminish the rate of proteid
metabolism much more regularly and constantly than increasing
quantities of fat. We may attribute this difference
in action, in a measure at least, to the greater ease in oxidation
and utilization of the carbohydrate. In any event,
starches and sugars are most valuable adjuncts to the daily
diet, because of this marked proteid-saving power, while their
fuel value adds just so much to the total energy intake.</p>

<p>A more striking illustration of the action of carbohydrate in
sparing proteid is seen in experiments on man, where the
nitrogen intake is reduced to a minimum, so as to constitute
a condition of specific nitrogen-hunger. In such a case, increasing
amounts of carbohydrate added to the intake reduce
enormously the using up of tissue proteid. The following
experiment with a young man 22 years old and 71.3 kilos
body-weight, reported by Landergren<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> affords good evidence
of the extent to which this proteid sparing power may manifest
itself.</p>

<p>We see here the nitrogen consumption fall to the exceedingly
low level of 3.34 grams per day, or 0.047 gram per kilo
of body-weight. To appreciate the full significance of this
drop in the extent of proteid metabolism, we may recall that
Succi, with a body-weight of only 62.4 kilos, on the seventh
day of fasting excreted 9.4 grams of nitrogen, corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
to a metabolism of 58.7 grams of tissue proteid. In other
words, with an intake of only 5.6 grams of proteid, the addition
of 908 grams of carbohydrate, with a total fuel value of
3745 calories, reduced the consumption of tissue proteid to
20.8 grams. The same individual, if fasting, would undoubtedly
have used up at least 70 grams of tissue proteid.</p>

<p>It is evident from what has been said that both of these
non-nitrogenous foods, fat and carbohydrate, play a very important
part in nutrition, because of their ability to maintain
in a measure the integrity of tissue proteid. When we recall
that a diet of pure proteid, such as meat or eggs, must be
excessive in quantity in order to meet the energy requirements
of the body, and that the stimulating action of proteid
food serves to whip up body metabolism, we can appreciate
at full measure the great physiological economy which results
from the addition of carbohydrate and fat to the daily diet.
The establishment of nitrogenous equilibrium is made possible
at a much lower level by the judicious addition of these
two non-nitrogenous foodstuffs. The same principle may be
illustrated in another way, viz., by noting the effect on tissue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
proteid of withdrawal of a portion of the fat or carbohydrate
of the intake, in the case of a person nearly or quite in nitrogen
balance. The following <span class="nowrap">experiment<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> affords a good example

<p>Starting with the body in a condition of plus nitrogen
balance, <i>i. e.</i>, with a mixed diet more than sufficient to maintain
the tissue proteid intact, the reduction of the fuel value
of the food from 1955 to 1493 calories by cutting off 112
grams of carbohydrate per day was followed by a gradual,
but marked, increase in the output of nitrogen; indicating
thereby the extent to which the body proteid was then drawn
upon to make good the loss of energy-containing income.
The body showed at the close of the experiment a minus
nitrogen balance averaging 2.2 grams per day, or a loss of
13.8 grams of tissue proteid, which would obviously have
continued, under the above conditions, until the body was
exhausted. In other words, the 112 grams of carbohydrate,
if added to the diet on December 3 and the following days,
would have quickly saved the daily loss of 2.4 grams of
nitrogen, and thus changed the drain of tissue proteid to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
actual gain, with consequent establishment of a growing plus
balance.</p>

<p>It is obvious from what has been stated, that in man the
body can accomplish a storing of proteid only when the
intake is reinforced by substantial additions of fat or carbohydrate.
It is plainly a matter of great physiological importance
that the body should be able to increase at times its
reserve of proteid. This, however, cannot apparently be
accomplished on a large scale under ordinary conditions.
Any storing up of nutritive material in excess, whether it
be proteid or fat, necessarily involves overfeeding, <i>i. e.</i>, the
taking of an amount of food beyond the capacity of the body
to metabolize at the time. Fat, as we know, may be stored
in large quantities, and it is in cases of overfeeding with
non-nitrogenous foods that we find accumulation of fat most
marked. Overfeeding with proteid, however, does not lead
to corresponding results, owing primarily to the peculiar
physiological properties of proteid; its general stimulating
effect on metabolism, the tendency of the body to establish
nitrogenous equilibrium at different levels, and the fact emphasized
by von Noorden that flesh deposition is primarily a
function of the specific energy of developing cells. In other
words, the protoplasmic cells of the body are more important
factors in the storing or holding on to proteid than an excess
of proteid-containing food.</p>

<p>It is generally considered as a settled fact, that in man
it is impossible to accomplish any large permanent storing
or deposition of flesh by overfeeding. Similarly, it is understood
that the muscular strength of man cannot be greatly
increased by an excessive intake of food. The only conditions
under which there is ordinarily any marked and
permanent flesh deposition are such as are connected with
the regenerative energy of living cells. Thus, as von
Noorden has stated, an accumulation or storing of tissue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
proteid is seen especially in the growing body, where new
cells are being rapidly constructed; also in the adult where
growth may have ceased, but where increased muscular
work has resulted in an hypertrophy or enlargement of the
muscular tissue; and lastly in those cases where, owing
to previous insufficient food or to the wasting away of the
body incidental to disease, the proteid content of the tissues
has been more or less diminished, and consequently an abundance
of proteid food is called for and duly utilized to make
good the loss. In some oft-quoted experiments by Krug,
conducted on himself, it was observed that with an abundant
food intake, sufficient to furnish 2590 calories per day (44
calories per kilo of body-weight), a condition approaching
nitrogenous equilibrium was easily maintained. On then
increasing the fuel value of the food to 4300 calories (71 calories
per kilo of body-weight) by addition of fat and carbohydrate,
there was during a period of fifteen days a sparing
of 49.5 grams of nitrogen or 309 grams of proteid, which
would correspond to about 1450 grams, or three pounds, of
fresh muscle. It is to be noted, however, that of this excess
of calories added to the intake only 5 per cent was made
use of for flesh deposit, the remaining 95 per cent going to
make fat.</p>

<p>Again, we may call attention to the well-known fact that
in feeding animals for food, while fat may be laid on in large
amounts, flesh cannot be so increased by overfeeding. In this
matter, however, race and individuality count for considerable.
Thus, there is on record a more recent series of experiments
conducted by <span class="nowrap">Dapper<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> on himself which shows some remarkable
results. Starting with a daily diet not excessive in
amount, he was able by an addition of only 80 grams of
starch to accomplish a laying up of 3.32 grams of nitrogen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
per day for a period of twelve days, or a total gain of 39.8
grams of nitrogen, equal to 248 grams of proteid. It may be
said that the gain of proteid or flesh here for the twelve days
was no greater than in the preceding case (fifteen days), but
the difference lies in the fact that Krug accomplished his
gain by increasing the daily intake from 2590 to 4300 calories,
an amount which he found too large to be eaten with
comfort, while the later investigator raised the fuel value
of his daily food from 2930 to only 3250 calories. As the
experiments by Dapper contain other points of interest bearing
on the question before us, we may advantageously consider
them somewhat in detail. The following table gives
the more important results:</p>

<p>As we look at these results, the nitrogen gain for the first
and second days of the third experiment and the first day of
the second experiment may well attract our attention, since
they show an astonishing laying by of proteid, or gain of flesh,
under the influence of a comparatively small increase in the
fuel value of the food. A gain of 5.98 grams of nitrogen
means 37.3 grams of proteid, or more than an ounce; by no
means an inconsiderable addition for one day to the store of
tissue proteid. In the third experiment, where plasmon (dried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
milk proteid) was added to the diet, there is to be noted a
gradual falling off in the proteid-sparing power, which may
perhaps be interpreted as implying that the body was practically
saturated with proteid, and that owing to this fact the
body was unable to continue its laying hold of nitrogen. In
the entire period of 21 days, however, the body had succeeded
in accumulating a store of 62.8 grams of nitrogen, or
392 grams of proteid, and this without adding very largely
to the intake of non-nitrogenous matter. This experiment
affords a striking illustration of the ability of the body to
“fatten on nitrogen,” but it is very doubtful if such results
can generally be obtained. Lüthje<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> however, has reported a
large retention of nitrogen on a diet containing 50 grams of
nitrogen daily, with a fuel value of 4000 calories. It is
more than probable that there existed in these particular
cases some personal peculiarity or idiosyncrasy which favored
the proteid-sparing power. The personal coefficient of nutrition
is not to be ignored; it shows itself in many ways, and
the above results are to be counted among those that are exceptional
and not the rule. In the words of Magnus-Levy,
“a given diet with Cassius may lead to different results than
with Anthony.”</p>

<p>For the study of many questions in nutrition, it becomes
necessary to determine accurately the transformations of
energy within the body as contrasted with the transformation
of matter; the total income and outgo of energy, measured
in terms of heat, are to be compared one with the other and
a balance struck. Further, in studying the metabolism of
carbohydrate and fat it is necessary to determine the output
of gaseous products through the lungs and skin; to estimate
the excretion of carbon dioxide and water, and the intake of
oxygen. For these purposes, a special form of apparatus
known as a respiration calorimeter is employed. The double<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
name is indicative of the twofold character of the apparatus,
viz., a suitably constructed chamber so arranged as to permit
of measuring at the same time the respiratory products and the
energy given off from the body. The form of apparatus best
known to-day, and with which exceedingly satisfactory work
has been done, is the Atwater-Rosa apparatus, as modified by
Benedict. It consists essentially of a respiration chamber, in
reality an air-tight, constant-temperature room (with walls
of sheet metal, outside of which are two concentric coverings
of wood completely surrounding it, with generous air spaces
between), sufficiently large to admit of a man living in it for
a week or more at a time. Connected with the chamber is
a great variety of complex apparatus for maintaining and
analyzing the supply of oxygen, determining the amount of
carbon dioxide and of water, etc., etc. As an apparatus for
measuring heat, the chamber may be described as “a constant-temperature,
continuous-flow water calorimeter, so devised
and manipulated that gain or loss of heat through the walls
of the chamber is prevented, and the heat generated within
the chamber cannot escape in any other way than that provided
for carrying it away and measuring it.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span></p>

<p>In illustration of the efficiency of an apparatus of this description,
and of the close agreement obtainable by direct calorimetric
measurement with the estimated energy, as figured from
the materials oxidized in the body, we may quote the following
data from Dr. Benedict’s report, referred to in the footnote.
The subject was a young man who had been fasting for five
days. The experiment deals with the metabolism on the first
day after the fast, when a diet composed mainly of milk was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
made use of, containing 53.31 grams of proteid, 211.87 grams
of fat, and 75.41 grams of carbohydrate. The following table
shows the results of the experiment:</p>

<p>As is seen from the above figures, the total fuel value of
the food was 2569 calories. The fuel value of the unoxidized
portion of the food contained in the excreta was 149 + 103
calories, leaving as the available energy of the food 2317
calories. This must be further corrected by the fact, mentioned
in the footnote, that a portion of the food was stored
as fat and glycogen, while the body lost at the same time a
small amount of proteid. Making the necessary correction
for these causes, we find 2088 calories as the energy from
material oxidized in the body. The actual output of energy
as measured by the calorimeter was 2113 calories, only 1.2
per cent greater than the estimated amount.</p>

<p>By aid of the respiration calorimeter, many important questions
in nutrition can be more or less accurately answered,
especially such as relate to the total energy requirements of
the body. The law of the conservation of energy obtains in
the human body as elsewhere, and if we can measure with
accuracy the total heat output, with any energy liberated in
the form of work, and at the same time determine the total
excretion of carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen, etc., together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
with the intake of oxygen, it becomes not only possible to
ascertain the energy requirements of the body under different
conditions, but, aided by data obtainable through study of the
exchange of matter, we can draw important conclusions concerning
the sources of the energy, <i>i. e.</i>, whether from proteid,
fat, or carbohydrate.</p>

<p>It is obvious that a man asleep, or lying quietly at rest, in
the calorimeter, especially when he has been without food for
some hours, furnishes suitable conditions for ascertaining the
minimal energy requirements of the body. Under such conditions,
bodily activity and heat output are at their lowest,
and we are thus afforded the means of determining what is
frequently called the basal energy exchange of the body.
The following table taken from Magnus-Levy, and embodying
results from many sources, shows the heat production
during sleep, calculated for 24 hours, of various individuals of
different body-weight and of different body surface.</p>

<p>I venture to present these individual results, rather than
make a general statement simply, because it is important to
recognize the fact that the basal energy exchange differs according
to body-weight, extent of body surface, and the condition
of the body. In the table, the results are arranged in
the order of body-weight, and it is plain to see that the absolute
energy exchange is greater with heavy persons than with
light, yet the energy exchange does not increase in proportion
to increase of body-weight. With a man of 83 kilos
body-weight, the basal exchange is only 30–40 per cent
higher than in a man of 43 kilos body-weight. In other
words, the man of small body-weight has, per kilo, a much
higher basal exchange than the heavier man. The energy
exchange is more closely proportional to the extent of body
surface than to weight.</p>

<p>As Richet has expressed it, the basal energy exchange is
inversely proportional to the body-weight and directly proportional
to the body surface. This is in harmony with the view
advanced by v. Hösslin, “that all the important physiological
activities of the body, including of course its internal work
and the consequent heat production, are substantially proportional
to the two-thirds power of its volume, and that since
the external surface bears the same ratio to the volume, a proportionality
necessarily exists between heat production and
surface.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span></p>

<p>There are, however, many circumstances that modify, or
influence, energy exchange. Thus, the taking of food, with
all the attendant processes of digestion, assimilation, etc., involves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
an expenditure of energy not inconsiderable. This
has been experimentally demonstrated on man by several investigators.
With fatty food, Magnus-Levy found that his
subject lying upon a couch, as completely at rest as possible,
produced in the 24 hours 1547 calories when 94 grams of fat
were eaten, and 1582 calories when 195 grams of fat were
consumed. The increase of heat production over the basal
energy exchange was 10 and 58 calories respectively. With
a mixed diet, where proteid food is a conspicuous element, the
increase in heat production is much more marked. Thus, in
some experiments reported from Sweden the following data
were obtained<span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span></p>

<p>We see here an increase of 495 calories per day in heat production,
due to metabolism of the food ingested. In other
words, with a basal energy exchange of 2022 calories, the
average of the five fasting days, energy equivalent to 495
calories was expended in taking care of the ingested food.
It should be added, however, that the daily ration here was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
somewhat excessive, 4193 calories being considerably in excess
of the requirements of the body. Finally, it should be
stated that of the several classes of foods, proteids cause the
greatest increase in metabolism and fats the least.</p>

<p>In studying heat production in the body under varying
conditions, one of the important aids in drawing conclusions
as to the character of the body material burned up is the
respiratory quotient. This is the relationship, or ratio, of
the oxygen absorbed to the oxygen of the carbon dioxide
eliminated, viz., <span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction2"><span class="fnum">CO<sub>2</sub></span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden2">O<sub>2</sub></span></span></span>. Carbohydrates (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)
all contain hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion to form
water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and in their oxidation they need of oxygen only
such quantity as will suffice to oxidize the carbon (C) of the
sugar to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Carbohydrates, starch and
sugars, have a respiratory quotient of 1.00. Fat, on the
other hand, has a respiratory quotient of 0.7, and proteid, 0.8.
Hence, it is easy to see that the respiratory quotient will
approach nearer to unity as the quantity of carbohydrate
burned in the body is increased. Similarly, the respiratory
quotient will grow smaller the larger the amount of fat
burned up. Practically, we never find a respiratory quotient
of 1.0 or 0.7, because there is always some oxidation of proteid
in the body. If, by way of illustration, we assume that
the energy of the body under given conditions comes from
proteid to the extent of 15 per cent, while the remaining 85
per cent is derived from the oxidation of carbohydrate, the
respiratory quotient will be 0.971. If, however, the 85 per
cent of energy comes from fat, the respiratory quotient will
change to 0.722. In the resting body, as in the early morning
hours, after a night’s sleep and before food is taken, the
respiratory quotient is generally in the neighborhood of 0.8.
When, however, as sometimes happens, the quotient at this
time of day approaches 0.9, it must be assumed that sugar is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
being burned in the body, presumably from carbohydrate still
circulating from the previous day’s intake.</p>

<p>As can easily be seen, any special drain upon either fat or
carbohydrate in the processes of the body will be indicated at
once by a corresponding change in the respiratory quotient.
This we shall have occasion to notice later on, in considering
the source of the energy of muscle contraction. Further, the
respiratory quotient will naturally change in harmony with
transformations in the body which involve alterations in
oxygen-content, without the oxygen of the inspired air being
necessarily involved; as in the formation of a substance poor
in oxygen, such as fat, from a substance rich in oxygen, such
as carbohydrate. Moreover, the reversal of this reaction, as in
the formation of sugar from proteid with a taking on of oxygen,
will produce a corresponding effect upon the respiratory
quotient. As Magnus-Levy has clearly pointed out, in the
formation of fat from carbohydrate, carbon dioxide is produced
in large amount without the oxygen of the inspired air
being involved at all. In such a change, 100 grams of starch
will yield about 42 grams of fat, while at the same time 45
grams of carbon dioxide will be produced. This might cause
the respiratory quotient to rise as high as 1.38. Again, in
the formation of sugar from proteid, the respiratory quotient
may sink very decidedly, the changes involved being accompanied
by a taking on of oxygen from the air, without,
however, any corresponding increase of carbon dioxide
in the expired air. Assuming a manufacture of 60 grams
of dextrose from 100 grams of proteid, <i>i. e.</i>, from the non-nitrogenous
moiety of the proteid molecule, a respiratory quotient
of 0.613 would be possible. Thus, a diabetic patient,
living upon a carbohydrate-free diet, consuming only proteid
and fat, may show a respiratory quotient of 0.613–0.707.
These illustrations will suffice to show how chemical alterations
taking place in the body, involving transformations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
proteid, fat, and carbohydrate of the tissues and of the food,
may produce alterations in the respiratory quotient without
necessarily being directly connected with intake of oxygen or
output of carbon dioxide through the lungs; and how, conversely,
the respiratory quotient becomes a factor of great
significance in throwing light upon the character of the
nutritive changes taking place in the body.</p>

<p>Among the various conditions that influence the energy
exchange of the body, muscle work stands out as the most
conspicuous. It needs no argument to convince one that all
forms of muscular activity involve liberation of the energy
stored up in the tissues of the body; and consequently that
all work accomplished means chemical decomposition, in
which complex molecules are broken down into simple ones
with liberation of the contained energy, the energy exchange
being proportional to the amount of work done. As we have
seen, the basal energy exchange of the normal individual is
ascertained by studying his heat production while at rest&mdash;best
during sleep&mdash;without food, when involuntary muscle
activity and heat production are at their lowest. The
maximum energy exchange is seen in the individual at hard
muscular work. Heat production is then at its highest, as
can be ascertained by direct calorimetric observation; or, by
studying the output of excretory products, which measure
the extent of the oxidative processes from which comes the
energy for the accomplishment of the work. As an illustration
of the general effect of muscular work on the energy exchange
of the body, we may cite a summary of some results
reported by Atwater and Benedict<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> the figures given being
average results, from several individuals, and covering different
periods of time. Though not strictly comparable in all
details, they are sufficiently so to illustrate the main principle.</p>

<p>The work done in these experiments was on a stationary
bicycle in the calorimeter, and the heat equivalent was calculated
from measurements made by an ergometer attached
to the bicycle. We are not concerned here with details, but
simply with the general question of the influence of muscular
work upon the energy exchange of the body. We note that
the work of the day periods, 7 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> to 7 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, resulted, in
the several cases brought together under the average figures,
in an increased heat production amounting to more than 100
per cent. Further, we observe that in the body, as in all
machines, only a fraction of the energy liberated by the
accelerated chemical decomposition, or oxidation, was manifested
as mechanical work, the larger part by far being heat
eliminated and lost. Thus, Zuntz has found that, in man,
about 35 per cent of the extra energy of the food used in
connection with external muscular work is available for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
work. This, however, shows a noticeably higher degree of
efficiency than is generally obtainable by the best steam or
oil engines. Lastly, attention may be called to the fact that
after the work of the day was finished at 7 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, the next
period of six hours still showed an accelerated metabolism, as
contrasted with what took place during absolute rest.</p>

<p>As bearing upon the exchange of matter in the body in connection
with muscular work, and as showing the relationship
which exists here between energy exchange and exchange of
matter, we may quote a few data relating to the elimination
of carbon dioxide; remembering that this substance represents
particularly the final oxidation product in the body of
carbonaceous materials, such as fat and carbohydrate. The
following data, taken from Atwater and Benedict<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> being
results of experiments upon the subject “J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;W.,” are of
value as showing the variations in output of carbon dioxide
that may be expected under the conditions described:</p>

<p>In considering these figures bearing on the output of carbon
dioxide under the conditions specified, we note at once
a correspondence with the total energy exchange, as indicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
in the preceding table. As previously stated, we are at
present dealing simply with generalities, and the important
point to be observed here is that muscular work&mdash;7 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>
to 7 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span>&mdash;in the work experiments, increases enormously
the output of carbon dioxide. We see clearly emphasized
a connection between the total energy exchange of the body,
as expressed in calories or heat units, and the oxidation of
carbonaceous material, of which carbon dioxide is the natural
oxidation product. We note that on the cessation of work&mdash;7
<span class="lowercase smcap">P.&nbsp;M.</span> to 7 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>&mdash;the output of carbon dioxide tends
to drop back to the level characteristic of the corresponding
period in rest, with or without food. In the experiment
with “extra severe muscular work,” the results are different
simply because here the subject worked sixteen hours,
necessitating a portion of the work being done at night-time.
Finally, it should be mentioned that the differences in output
of carbon dioxide in these experiments are somewhat
greater than in many experiments of this type, although all
show the same general characteristics. This may be explained,
as stated by the authors from whom the data are
taken, “by the fact that J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;W. was a larger and heavier
man than any of the others; that the differences in diet were
wider, and that the amounts of external muscular work were
larger in these experiments than in those with the other
subjects.”</p>

<p>If we pass from experiments of this type, conducted in
a calorimeter, to those cases where competitive trials of endurance
are held by trained athletes, <i>i. e.</i>, where external
muscular activity is pushed to the extreme limit, we then see
even more strikingly displayed the effect of work in increasing
the energy exchange of the body. One of the best illustrations
of this type of experiment is to be found in the observations
made in connection with the six-day bicycle race
held in New York City, at the Madison Square Garden, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
December, 1898<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> The observations in question were made
upon three of the athletes, one of whom withdrew early in
the fourth day, while the others continued until the close of
the race&mdash;142 consecutive hours&mdash;winning the first and
fourth places, respectively. The following table gives the
computation of energy of the material metabolized, exclusive
of body-fat lost:</p>

<p>The special significance of these data, as bearing upon
the topic under discussion, is that apparently all three of the
subjects were drawing in a measure upon their body material.
As stated by Atwater and Sherman, Pilkington lost per day
5.1 grams of nitrogen; that is to say, the total nitrogen excreted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
exceeded the total nitrogen of the food by 5.1 grams
per day, corresponding to 33 grams of proteid, which must
have been drawn from the supply in the body. If we assume
that lean flesh contains 25 per cent of proteid, this would
mean about <span class="nowrap">4 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">3</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> ounces per day. The other two subjects,
Miller and Albert, lost from the body per day 8.6 grams and
7.1 grams respectively of nitrogen, which would imply a loss
of about 54 grams and 44 grams of body proteid respectively,
or 8 ounces and <span class="nowrap">6 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> ounces of lean flesh per day. It is evident,
therefore, that none of the three subjects consumed
sufficient food to avoid loss of body proteid, under the existing
conditions of muscular activity. Indeed, it may be noted
in Miller’s case that the average fuel value of the food per
day was 4770 calories, while the average expenditure of
energy per day was 4820 calories. We should naturally
expect, however, that any small deficiency in fuel value
would be made good by a call upon body fat. “Why the
body should use its own substance under such circumstances
is a question which at present cannot be satisfactorily answered.
The fact that such was the case, each of the contestants
who finished the race consuming during the period
body protein equivalent to 2 or 3 pounds of lean flesh, and
that no injury resulted therefrom, would seem to indicate
that these men had stores of protein which could be metabolized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
to aid in meeting the demands put upon the body by
the severe exertion, without robbing any of the working
parts, and at the same time relieving the system of a part of
the labor of digestion. Possibly, the ability to carry such
a store of available protein is one of the factors which make
for physical endurance.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> This possibility we shall have
occasion to discuss in another connection. At present, the
facts presented are to be accepted as accentuating the general
law that the energy exchange of the body, everything else
being equal, is increased proportionally to increase in the
extent of external muscular activity. It may be noted that
Albert, who did considerably less work than Miller, showed
a much larger exchange of energy than the latter athlete.
This, however, is to be connected with the fact that his fuel
intake was 1300 calories larger per day than Miller’s; in other
words, the conditions were not equal. This fact also calls to
mind the observations of Schnyder<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> who, studying the relationship
between muscular activity and the production of
carbon dioxide, maintained that the quantity of this excretory
product formed depends less upon the amount of work accomplished
than upon the intensity of the exertion; efficiency in
muscular work varying greatly with the condition of the subject,
and his familiarity with the particular task involved.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it is obvious that oxygen consumption,
as well as output of carbon dioxide, must vary
enormously with variations in the muscular activity of the
body. The one important factor influencing the quantities
of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanged in the lungs, <i>i. e.</i>,
the extent of the respiratory interchange, is muscular activity;
and since, as we have seen, carbonaceous material is the substance
mainly oxidized in muscle work, it follows, as carbon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
dioxide is excreted principally through the lungs, that the
respiratory interchange becomes in good measure an indicator
of the extent of chemical decomposition incidental to external
work. If we recall that man, on an average, at each inspiration
draws in about 500 cubic centimeters of air (30 cubic
inches), and that for the 24 hours he averages 15 breaths a
minute, it is easy to see that in one minute the average man
will inspire 7.5 litres of air, or 450 litres an hour, with a
total of 10,800 litres for the entire day, which is equivalent
to about 380 cubic feet. This would be a volume of air just
filling a room <span class="nowrap">7 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">3</span></span></span> feet in length, width, and height. Inspired
air loses to the body 4.78 volumes per cent of oxygen, while
expired air contains an excess of 4.34 volumes per cent of
carbon dioxide. In muscular work, respiration is increased
in frequency and in depth. The volume of air exchanged
in the lungs during severe labor may be increased sevenfold,
while oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide excretion are
frequently increased 7–10 times. The following figures,
being values for one minute, show the effect on oxygen consumption
of walking on a level and climbing, the subject
being a man of 55.5 kilos body-weight<span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span></p>

<p>Remembering that these figures represent the oxygen consumption
for only one minute of time, it is easy to see the
striking effect of moderate and vigorous exercise on respiratory
interchange. Simply walking along a level suffices to
increase the consumption of oxygen threefold over what
occurs when the body stands at rest. When the more vigorous
exercise attendant on lifting the body up a steep incline
is attempted, most striking is the great increase in the
amount of oxygen consumed. We thus see another forcible
illustration of the influence of muscular activity upon the
exchange of matter in the body, and a further confirmation
of the statement, so many times made, that oxidation&mdash;especially
the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates by which
large quantities of heat are set free, easily convertible into
mechanical energy&mdash;is a primary factor in the metabolic
processes, by which the machinery of the living man is able
to work so efficiently.</p>

<p>Finally, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the outgoings
of the body, in the form of matter and energy, are subject to
great variation, incidental to the degree of activity of the
day or hour. The ordinary vicissitudes of life, bringing
days of physical inaction, followed perhaps by periods of
unusual activity; changes in climatic conditions, with their
influence upon heat production in the body; alterations in the
character and amount of the daily dietary, etc.,&mdash;all seemingly
combine as natural obstacles to the maintenance of a
true nutritive balance. Outgo, however, must be met by
adequate amounts of proper intake if there is to be an approach
toward a balance of nutrition. In some way the
normal, healthy man does maintain, approximately at least,
a condition of balance; not necessarily for every hour or for
every day, but the intake and outgo if measured for a definite
period, not too short, say for a week or two, will be found to
approach each other very closely. Body equilibrium and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
approximate nitrogen balance may be reasonably looked for,
as well as a balance of total energy, in the case of a healthy
man leading a life which conforms to ordinary physiological
requirements. The man who, on the other hand, consciously
or unconsciously, continues an intake way beyond the outgo,
whose daily income of nitrogen and total fuel value far exceeds
the requirements of his body, obviously lives with an
accumulating plus balance, which ordinarily shows itself in
increasing body-weight and with a storing away of fat.</p>

<p>Equally conspicuous is the effect of an inadequate income
of proper nutriment; a food supply which persistently fails to
furnish the available nitrogen and total energy value called for
by the body under the conditions prevailing, will inevitably
result in a minus balance, which, if continued too long, must
of necessity tax the body’s store to the danger limit. At the
same time, the well-nourished individual, without being unduly
burdened by a bulky store of energy-containing material,
is always supplied with a sufficient surplus to meet all
rational demands, when from any cause the intake fails, for
brief periods of time, to be commensurate with the needs of the
body. It is reasonable to believe, however, that in the maintenance
of good health, and the preservation of a high degree
of efficiency, the body should be kept in a condition approaching
a true nutritive balance.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, every form of muscular activity
begets an increase in the energy exchange of the body.
Between the two extremes of absolute rest and excessive
muscular exertion, we find differences of 2000 calories
or more per day as representing the degree of chemical decomposition
corresponding to the particular state of muscular
activity. The work of the involuntary muscles, such as
have to do with peristalsis, respiration, rhythmical beat of the
heart, etc., is a relatively constant factor, though naturally
subject to some variation, as has been pointed out in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
connections. External muscular activity, however, is the one
factor above all others that modifies the rate of energy exchange.
A little longer walk, a heavier load to carry, a steeper
hill to climb, any increase great or small in the activity of
the muscles of the body, means a corresponding increase in
chemical decomposition, with increased output of the ordinary
products of tissue oxidation. The material so consumed, or
oxidized, must be made good to hold the body in equilibrium;
the supplies drawn upon are to be replaced, if the tissues of
the body are to be kept in a proper state of efficiency.</p>

<p>What is the nature of the material used up in connection
with muscle work? As can readily be seen, this is an important
question, for on its answer depends, in some measure at least,
the character of the proper intake, or food, to be supplied in
order to make good the loss. If the energy of mechanical
work, the energy of muscle contraction, comes from the
breaking down of proteid matter alone, then obviously excessive
muscular work would need to be accompanied, or followed,
by a generous supply of proteid food. If, on the other
hand, external work means liberation of energy solely from
non-nitrogenous materials, then it is equally clear that fats
and carbohydrates are the proper foods to offset the drain
incidental to vigorous muscular action.</p>

<p>The views of Liebig, briefly referred to in a previous chapter,
held sway over physiologists for many years. His
dictum that proteid foods were true plastic foods, entering
into the structure of the tissues of the body, and that they
alone were the real sources of muscular energy, met for a
time with no opposition. It was not until the advent of
a more critical spirit, accompanied by a fuller appreciation
of the necessity of experimental evidence, that physiologists
began to test with scientific accuracy the validity of the current
views. It is worthy of note that long prior to this time,
even before oxygen was discovered, the far-sighted and resourceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
John Mayow, in his work with the various “spirits”
of the body and their relation to respiration, etc., evolved the
view that muscular power has its origin in the combustion of
fat brought to the muscles by the blood and burned there by
aid of a gas or “spirit” taken from the air by the lungs, and
likewise carried to the muscles by the circulating blood. Considering
the time when Mayow lived and the dearth of true
scientific knowledge as we measure it to-day, his hypothesis
was a wonderful forestalling of present views.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that the views of Liebig, if true, admit
of easy proof; since, if the energy of muscular power comes
from the breaking down of proteid, there should be a certain
parallelism between the output of nitrogen from the body and
the amount of muscular work accomplished, everything else
being equal. As stated in a previous chapter, such study of
this question as was made soon disclosed the fact that the one
element above all others that seemed to influence the output
of nitrogen was the intake of proteid food. Thus, the English
investigators, Lawes and Gilbert, found by experimenting
with animals that when the latter were kept under
uniform conditions of muscular work, the amount of nitrogen
excreted ran parallel with the intake of nitrogen. Further,
in the early experiments of Voit, the results obtained
clearly showed that variations in the amount of work performed
were practically without influence on the excretion
of nitrogenous waste products.</p>

<p>The experiment, however, that came as a death blow to
the theories of Liebig was that of Fick and Wislicenus<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span>
who in 1865 made an ascent of the Faulhorn, 6500 feet
high, using a diet wholly non-nitrogenous. From the
nitrogen excreted they were able, of course, to calculate
the amount of proteid oxidized in the body during the period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
of work, and found that the proteid consumed could not
have furnished, at the most, more than one-half the energy
required to lift the weights of their bodies to the top of
the high peak. Further, they observed that neither during
the work period, nor immediately after, was there any
noticeable increase in the excretion of nitrogen. Obviously,
as they state, the oxidation of proteid matter in the body
cannot be the exclusive source of the energy of muscular
contraction, since the measurable amount of external work
performed in the ascent of the mountain was far greater than
the equivalent of the energy capable of being furnished by
the proteid actually burned. To which may be added the
fact that considerable energy, not measurable in their experiment,
must have been employed in the work of the
involuntary muscles of the body; thus increasing by so much
the difference between the muscular work actually accomplished
and the available energy from proteid consumed. It
is true that minor criticisms regarding certain details of the experiment
can be offered to-day, such as the fact that the men
were, in a measure, in a state of “nitrogen starvation,” etc.,
but these criticisms do not in any degree militate against the
main thesis that the energy of muscular contraction does not
come exclusively from the consumption or breaking down of
proteid, either of food or tissue. Vigorous and even severe
muscular work does not necessarily increase the decomposition
of proteid material. Dogs made to run in large treadmills,
with the same diet as on resting days, were found to
excrete practically no more nitrogen than during the days of
rest. Occasionally, however, in some one experiment the
output of nitrogen would show an increase over the output
on resting days. Further, experiments made with horses led
to essentially the same result, except that greater increase
in the excretion of nitrogen was observed than with dogs.
This increase in nitrogen output, however, as a concomitant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
of increased muscular activity, could be prevented by adding
to the amount of carbohydrate food.</p>

<p>While experiments of this nature, on man and animals, all
tended to show little or no increase in the excretion of nitrogen,
as a result of muscle work; and likewise no increase in
the output of sulphur and phosphorus, thus strengthening
the view that muscular energy is not the result of proteid
disintegration, there was observed marked increase in the
consumption of oxygen, and in the excretion of carbon dioxide.
Non-nitrogenous matter was thus at once suggested as the
material with which muscle chiefly does its work. There is
to-day no question of the general truth of this statement, yet
there are other aspects of the problem to be considered before
we can lay it aside. Pflüger, working with dogs, and Argutinsky,
experimenting on himself by arduous mountain climbing,
reached conclusions seemingly quite opposed to what has
just been said. Their results, however, admit of quite a
different interpretation from what they were disposed to attach
to them. Thus, <span class="nowrap">Pflüger<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> would go back to the old view that
all muscle work is at the expense of proteid material, because
lean dogs fed mainly, or entirely, on meat and made to do an
excessive amount of work were found by him to excrete nitrogen
somewhat in proportion to the amount of work done.
Argutinsky<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> likewise, in his mountain climbing carried to the
point of fatigue, and with a high proteid intake likewise, saw
in the increased output of nitrogen a suggestion of the same
idea. In reality, however, their results merely prove that,
under some circumstances, proteid may serve as the chief
source of muscular energy; as when the body is poor in fat
and carbohydrate, or when the intake consists solely of proteid
matter. In other words, muscular work may result in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
an increased excretion of nitrogen when the work is very
severe, and there is not a corresponding increase in the fats
or carbohydrates (fuel ingredients) of the food. In the
words of Bunge<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> “we might assume <i>à priori</i>, on teleological
grounds, that in the performance of its most important functions
the organism is to a certain extent independent of the
quality of its food. As long as non-nitrogenous food is supplied
in adequate quantity or is stored up in the tissues,
muscular work is chiefly maintained from this store. When
it is gone the proteids are attacked.”</p>

<p>There is no question that the energy of muscular contraction
can come from all three classes of organic foodstuffs.
Voluntary muscular movement is under the control of the nervous
system, and when the stimulus is applied the muscle is
bound to contract, provided of course there is sufficient
energy-containing material present to furnish the means.
Muscle tissue, like other tissues and organs, has a certain
power of adaptability, by which it is able to do its work,
even though it is not adequately supplied with its preferred
nutrient. While proteid is plainly not the material from
which the energy of muscular contraction is ordinarily derived,
it is equally evident that in emergency, as when the
usual store of carbohydrate and fat is wanting, proteid can
be drawn upon, and in such cases vigorous work may be
attended with increased nitrogen output. In harmony with
this statement, we find on record in recent years many experiments,
both with man and animals, where severe muscular
labor is accompanied by an excretion of nitrogen beyond
what occurs on days of rest; but by simply adding to the
intake of non-nitrogenous food this increased outgo of nitrogen
is at once checked. With moderate work, the nitrogen
outgo is rarely influenced; it is only when the work becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
excessive, or the store of non-nitrogenous reserve is small
and the intake of the latter food is limited, that proteid
matter is drawn upon to supply the required energy.</p>

<p>Recalling what has been said regarding the significance
of the respiratory quotient, it is obvious that we have here
a means of acquiring information as to the character of the
material that is burned up in the body during muscular work.
Increased metabolism of carbohydrate will necessarily result
in raising the respiratory quotient, and if the latter food
material alone is involved the respiratory quotient must
naturally approach 1.0. Zuntz, however, has clearly shown
that vigorous muscular activity does not materially change
the respiratory quotient; except in cases of very severe work,
where the oxygen-supply of the muscles is interfered with.
Indeed, the muscles may be made to do work sufficient to
increase the consumption of oxygen threefold or more, without
any change in the respiratory quotient being observed.
And as there is frequently no change whatever in the output of
nitrogen under these conditions, it follows that the energy
of the muscle work must have come from the decomposition
of non-nitrogenous material. If carbohydrates alone were
involved, the respiratory quotient would obviously undergo
change. Since, however, this remains practically stationary,
we are led to the conclusion that fat must be involved in
large degree, in addition to carbohydrate.</p>

<p>In this connection, it is a significant fact that with <i>fasting</i>
animals, where the store of carbohydrate material is more or
less used up, severe muscle work may be accomplished without
any appreciable increase in nitrogen output, thus showing
that proteid material is not involved and clearly pointing to
fat as the source of the muscular energy. Thus, in an experiment
referred to by Leathes, a dog on the sixth and seventh
day of starvation was made to do work in a treadmill equivalent
to climbing to a height of 1400 meters, yet the output of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
nitrogen was increased from six to only six and a half grams.
Obviously, not much of the energy of this muscle work could
have come from the breaking down of proteid, but it must
have been derived mainly from the oxidation of fat. There is
abundant evidence that fat can be used as a source of energy
by muscles, as well as carbohydrates and proteids, and there
is every reason for believing that the yield of work for a given
amount of chemical energy in the form of fat is as good as in
the case of either of the other two substances. In fact, the
observations of Zuntz show that fat can be used just as
economically by the body for muscle work as either carbohydrates
or proteid. Thus, in one experiment<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> he determined
the oxygen-consumption and respiratory quotient in a man
resting and working on three different diets&mdash;one principally
fat, one principally carbohydrate, and the other principally
proteid&mdash;and found that slightly less oxygen and energy
were required to do work on the fat diet than on the others.
This is clearly shown in the following table:</p>

<p>From these data, we see that per kilogram-meter of work
less energy was required and less oxygen consumed with fat
than with either of the other two foodstuffs; but practically,
fat and carbohydrate as sources of muscle energy have about
the same value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>Much stress is ordinarily laid upon the importance of a
large intake of proteid food whenever the body is called
upon to perform severe, or long-continued, muscular work;
but in view of what has been stated it may be questioned
whether there is any real physiological justification
for such custom. The pedestrian Weston<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> who in 1884
walked 50 miles a day for 100 consecutive days, was found
by Blyth during a period of five days to consume in his food
37.2 grams of nitrogen a day, while he excreted only 35.3
grams, leaving a balance of 1.9 grams of nitrogen per day
apparently stored in the body. His daily food during this
period was composed of 262 grams of proteid, 64.6 grams of
fat, and 799 grams of carbohydrate, with an estimated fuel
value of 4850 calories. Yet he performed this large amount
of work daily, and still laid by a certain amount of proteid on
a ration, the energy value of which would not ordinarily be
considered high for the muscular work to be done. Fourteen
years prior to this, Weston, while in New York, was carefully
studied by Dr. Flint during a period of 15 days, on
5 of which he walked a total of 317 miles. His diet was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
essentially a proteid diet, consisting principally of beef extract,
oatmeal gruel, and raw eggs. Nitrogen intake and
output were carefully compared during the days of rest and
during the days of work, with the results tabulated.</p>

<p>In this case it will be noted that the daily ration was comparatively
small, and, further, that during the working period
the subject consumed much less proteid than on the resting
days. Moreover, when we remember that the total energy
value of his diet must have been quite small, it is not at all
strange that in the laborious task of walking 62 miles a day
he should have temporarily drawn upon his store of body
proteid to the extent of 62.5 grams, or 10 grams of nitrogen
a day. Such experiences, however, do not by any means
constitute proof that in excessive muscular work there is
need for the consumption of correspondingly increased quantities
of proteid food, or that the energy of muscular work
comes preferably from the breaking down of proteid material.
Carbohydrate and fat unquestionably take precedence over
proteid in this respect, and we may accept as settled the
view that in all practical ways carbohydrate and fat stand
on an equal footing as sources of muscular energy. Less
clear, perhaps, is the question as to how these two radically
different types of organic material are utilized by the muscle.
It has been a favorite belief among some physiologists that
the contracting muscle makes use of only one substance as
the direct source of its energy, and that this substance is the
sugar dextrose. This view would seemingly imply that fat
and proteid must undergo alteration prior to their utilization
by the muscle; that, possibly, the carbon of the fat and proteid
is transformed into sugar before the muscle can make use of
it. So far as fat is concerned, this view is not supported by
the facts available, since experiments show that the heat and
energy liberated in the utilization of a given amount of fat
in muscle work are in harmony with the energy value of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
fat; in other words, the fat is apparently burned, or oxidized,
directly, without undergoing previous transformation into any
form of carbohydrate; or, if transformation does occur, under
some conditions, it must take place within the muscle and
without loss of energy. The practical significance of these
facts is at once apparent, for if fat, in order to be available as
a source of muscle energy, must first undergo conversion into
sugar, it would be far more economical from a physiological
standpoint to replace the fat of the diet with carbohydrate in
any attempt to provide suitable nourishment for the working
muscle. We may safely conclude, however, that fat and
carbohydrate, as previously suggested, are in reality both
capable of direct metabolism by the muscular tissue, and that
each is of value as a source of muscular energy in proportion to
its heat of combustion, yielding substantially the same proportion
of its potential energy in the form of mechanical work.</p>

<p>Regarding the utilization of proteid as a source of energy
by the muscle, there are many grounds for believing that
here the body has to deal with certain alterations, before the
proteid can be made available. We may indeed conjecture
the transformation of a non-nitrogenous portion of the proteid
molecule into carbohydrate, as a necessary step in its
utilization for muscle work. It is certainly true that in the
ordinary katabolic processes, through which proteid passes,
there is a tendency for the nitrogen-containing portion to be
quickly split off and eliminated, leaving a carbonaceous residue
which may represent as much as 80 per cent of the total
energy of the original proteid. This so-called carbon moiety
of the proteid molecule is apparently much less rapidly oxidized
than the nitrogenous portion, and may indeed be temporarily
stored in the body, in the form of fat or carbohydrate<span class="nowrap">.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span><a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span>
We have very convincing proof that the carbohydrate
glycogen can be formed from proteid. Thus, the feeding
of proteid to warm-blooded animals may be accompanied
by an accumulation of glycogen in the liver. This is interpreted
as meaning that in the cleavage of proteid by digestion
the various nitrogenous products formed are somewhere,
probably in the liver, still further acted upon; the contained
nitrogen with some of the carbon being converted into urea,
while the non-nitrogenous residue is transformed into glycogen,
or sugar. That some such change takes place, or, more
specifically, that carbohydrate does result from proteid is
more strikingly shown in human beings suffering with diabetes.
In severe forms of this disease, all carbohydrate food
consumed is rapidly eliminated through the kidneys in the
form of sugar, the body having lost the power of burning
sugar. If such a person is placed upon a diet composed exclusively
of proteid, sugar still continues to be excreted, and
there is observed a certain definite relationship between the
nitrogen output and the excretion of sugar, thus implying
that they have a common origin.</p>

<p>Further, there are certain drugs, such as phloridzin,
which, when introduced into the circulation, set up a severe
diabetes and glycosuria. Dogs treated in this way, fed
solely on proteid or even starved for some time, will continue
to excrete sugar, and as in the previous instance,
there is observed a certain definite ratio between the
nitrogen output and the elimination of sugar; thus leading
to the conclusion that both arise from the destruction of
the proteid molecule. Careful study of this ratio of dextrose
to nitrogen has led Lusk to the conclusion that full 58
per cent of the proteid may undergo conversion into sugar
in the body. Hence, it is easy to see how in muscle work,
when proteid is the sole source of the energy of muscular
contraction, the work accomplished may still result from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
direct oxidation of carbohydrate material, indirectly derived
from the proteid molecule. It requires no argument, however,
to convince one that such a procedure for the normal
individual is less economical physiologically than a direct
utilization of carbohydrate and fat, introduced as such and
duly incorporated with the muscle substance. Consequently,
in the nourishment of the body for vigorous muscular work,
there is reason in a diet which shall provide an abundance of
carbohydrate and fat; proteid being added thereto only in
amounts sufficient to meet the ordinary requirements of
the body for nitrogen and to furnish, it may be, proper
pabulum for the development of fresh muscle fibres, where,
as in training, effort is being made to strengthen the muscle
tissue and so enable it to do more work. Increase in proteid
food may help to make new tissue, but the source of
the energy of muscle work is to be found mainly in the
breaking down of the non-nitrogenous materials, carbohydrate
and fat.</p>

<p>In view of these facts, we may advantageously consider
next the real significance of the proteid metabolism of the
body. As we have seen, a meal rich in proteid leads at once&mdash;within
a few hours&mdash;to an excretion of urea equivalent
to full 50 per cent of the nitrogen of the ingested proteid,
while a few hours later finds practically all of the nitrogen
of the intake eliminated from the body. Further, it is to be
remembered that in a general way this occurs no matter what
the condition of the body may be at the time and no matter
how large or small the amount of proteid consumed. In
other words, there is practically no appreciable storing of
nitrogen or proteid for future needs,&mdash;at least none that is
proportional to the increase in nitrogen intake, even though
the body be in a condition approximating to nitrogen starvation.
Moreover, it is to be recalled that the increased proteid
metabolism attendant on increased intake of proteid food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
is accompanied by an acceleration of the metabolism of non-nitrogenous
matter; thus resulting in a stirring up of tissue
change, with consequent oxidation and loss of a certain proportion
of accumulated fat and carbohydrate. Coincident
with this increased excretion of nitrogen, the output of
carbon dioxide is likewise increased somewhat, due as is believed
mainly to increased metabolism of the involuntary
muscle fibres of the gastro-intestinal tract, by action of which
the accelerated peristalsis so characteristic of food intake is
accomplished. Further, the increased output of carbon
dioxide, under these conditions, is to be attributed also to
the greater activity of the digestive and excretory organs,
naturally stimulated to greater functional power by the
presence of proteid foods and their decomposition products.
Still, as stated by Leathes, “the two main end-products of
proteid metabolism, urea and carbonic acid, are, to a great
extent, produced independently of each other, and the reactions
which result in the discharge of the nitrogen are not
those in which energy is set free, work done, and carbonic
acid produced.” In other words, there is suggested what
we have already referred to, viz., that in proteid metabolism
a nitrogenous portion of the proteid molecule is quickly split
off and gotten rid of, while the non-nitrogenous part may be
reserved for future oxidation, serving as a source of muscle
energy or for other purposes. This being so, it is plain that
“proteid metabolism in so far as it is concerned with the
evolution of energy, proteid metabolism in its exothermic
stages, may be almost entirely non-nitrogenous metabolism”
(Leathes).</p>

<p>Is there any advantage to the body, however, in this
carbonaceous residue of the proteid molecule over simple
carbohydrate and fat? Can the processes of the body be accomplished
more economically, or more advantageously, with
a daily diet so constructed that the tissues and organs must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
depend mainly upon this carbon moiety of the proteid molecule
for their energy-yielding material? It has been one of
the physiological dogmas of the past, that the tissues and
organs of the body, or rather their constituent cells, preferred
to use proteid for all their needs whenever it was available.
If proteid were wanting, either because of insufficient intake,
or because of excessive activity, then the tissue cells would
draw upon their store of non-nitrogenous material. Food
proteid and tissue proteid, however, were the materials preferred
by the organism, so ran the argument, and the large and
incessant output of nitrogen which accompanied the intake of
proteid was accepted as proof of the general truth of this idea.
We might well question wherein lies the great advantage
to the body in this continual excretion of nitrogen; whether
the loss of energy in handling and removing the nitrogenous
portion of the necessarily large proteid intake, in order to
render available the non-nitrogenous part of the molecule,
might not more than compensate for the supposed gain? But
the truly astonishing fact that the output of nitrogen runs
parallel with the intake of proteid, that the body cannot store
up nitrogen to any large extent, has been taken as conclusive
evidence that the organism prefers to use proteid for all of its
requirements. Truly, we might just as well argue that this
significant rise in the excretion of nitrogen after partaking of
a proteid meal is an indication that the body has no need of
this excess of nitrogen; that it is indeed a possible source
of danger, since the system strives vigorously to rid itself of
the surplus, and that the energy-needs of the body can be
much more advantageously and economically met from fat
and carbohydrate than from the carbonaceous residue resulting
from the disruption of the proteid molecule.</p>

<p>In discussing these questions, we shall need to refer to
several of the current theories concerning proteid metabolism,
notably, the theories of Voit, Pflüger, and Folin. In 1867<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Carl Voit<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> of Munich, advanced the view that the proteid
material of the body exists in two distinct forms, viz., as
“morphotic” or “organized” proteid, representing proteid
which has actually become a part of the living units of the
body, <i>i. e.</i>, an integral part of the living tissues; and “circulating”
proteid, or that which exists in the internal meshes
of the tissue, or in the surrounding lymph and circulating
blood. The real point of distinction here is that while one
portion of the body proteid is raised to the higher plane of
living matter, <i>i. e.</i>, becomes a component part of the living
protoplasm, another and perhaps larger portion is outside of
the morphological framework of the tissue, constituting a
sort of internal medium which bathes the living cells, and
acts as middleman between the blood and lymph on the one
side and the living cells on the other. According to Voit’s
view, it is this circulating proteid that undergoes metabolism;
the proteid of the food after digestion and absorption being
carried to the different tissues and organs, and then, without
becoming an integral part of the living protoplasm of the
cells, it is broken down under the influence of the latter.
Obviously, small numbers of tissue cells are constantly
dying, their proteid matter passing into solution, where it
likewise undergoes metabolism. In other words, according
to Voit, the great bulk of the proteid undergoing katabolism
is the circulating proteid, derived more or less directly from
the food, and which at no time has been a part of the tissue
framework; while a smaller, but more constant amount,
represents the breaking down of tissue cells. This conception
of proteid metabolism is akin to our conception of morphological
and physiological destruction. In the words of
Foster: “We know that an epithelial cell, as notably in the
case of the skin, may be bodily cast off and its place filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
by a new cell; and probably a similar disappearance of and
renewal of histological units takes place in all the tissues of
the body to a variable extent. But in the adult body these
histological transformations are, in the cases of most of the
tissues, slow and infrequent. A muscle, for instance, may
suffer very considerable wasting and recover from that wasting
without any loss or renewal of its elementary fibres.
And it is obvious that the metabolism of which we are now
speaking does not involve any such shifting of histological
units. On the other hand, we find these histological units,
the muscle fibre or the gland cell, for instance, living on
their internal medium, the blood, or rather on the lymph,
which is the middleman between themselves and the actual
blood flowing in the vascular channels.”</p>

<p>Voit claims that the proteid dissolved in the fluids of the
body is more easily decomposable than that which exists combined
in organized form, or as more or less insoluble tissue
proteid; and it is this soluble and circulating form which,
under the influence of the living cells, undergoes destruction
or metabolism. We know, as has been previously stated,
that oxidation does not take place to any extent in the
circulating blood, and similarly there is every reason for
believing that proteid metabolism does not occur in this
menstrum. Metabolism is limited mainly to the active
tissues of the body, but according to the present conception
of the matter it does not occur at the expense of
the proteid of the living cells, but involves material contained
in the fluids bathing the cells; <i>i. e.</i>, it is not the
organized proteid that undergoes metabolism, but the proteid
circulating in and about the internal meshes of the cells and
tissues, the living cell being the active agent in controlling
the process. Further, this view lessens the difficulty of
understanding the elimination of nitrogen after a meal rich
in proteid. If it was necessary to assume that all the proteid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
of our daily food is built up into living protoplasm before
katabolism occurs, it would be exceedingly difficult to explain
the sudden and rapid elimination of nitrogen which
follows the ingestion of proteid. For example, we can
hardly imagine that merely eating an excess of proteid food
will lead to an actual breaking down of the living framework
of the tissues, equivalent to the amount of nitrogen which the
body at once eliminates. Voit’s theory, on the other hand,
supposes a twofold origin of the nitrogen excreted; one part,
the larger and variable portion, comes from the direct metabolism
of the circulating proteid, being the immediate result of
the ingested food and varying in amount with the quantity
of proteid food consumed; the other, smaller and less variable
in amount, has its origin in the metabolism of the
true tissue proteid, or the actual living framework of the
body.</p>

<p>In a fasting animal, the tissues and organs of the body still
contain a large proportion of proteid matter, yet only a small
fraction of this proteid is eliminated each day, hardly 1 per
cent. If, however, proteid is absorbed from the intestine,
proteid metabolism is at once increased, and the excretion of
nitrogen may be fifteen times greater than during hunger.
In other words, the extent of proteid metabolism is not at
all proportional to the total amount of proteid contained in
the body as a whole, but runs parallel in a general way with
the quantity of proteid absorbed from the intestine. Obviously,
the newly absorbed proteid is quite different in
nature from the proteid which in much larger amounts is
deposited throughout the body, since it is not organized and
is so much more easily decomposable (Voit). This is the
circulating proteid of the body; it exists in solution, and it is
a significant fact that, according to Voit, the chemical transformations
that characterize proteid katabolism occur only in
solution. The organized proteid, on the other hand, is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
a state of suspension, and its katabolism, which is relatively
very small, is preceded by solution of the proteid in the
fluids of the tissue, after which its further breaking down is
assumed to be the same as that of the circulating proteid.
This latter view is a fundamental part of the Voit theory; in
long-continued fasting, for example, the living protoplasm
of the various tissues and organs is of necessity drawn upon
for the nourishment of the more vital parts of the body, such
as the brain, spinal cord, etc., consequently the organized proteid
is gradually dissolved and then decomposed, after it has
become liquefied and has thus lost its organized structure.</p>

<p>In this conception of proteid metabolism, we picture the
different organs and tissues of the body as being permeated
by a fluid which carries variable amounts of nutritive material,
the quantity of the latter determining in a way the extent
of the proteid katabolism which shall take place. As
the proteid of the food passes into the blood and lymph, the
fluids bathing the cells are correspondingly enriched, and as
a result, proteid katabolism is accelerated in parallel degree.
During hunger, on the other hand, the organized proteid of
the tissue cells is gradually liquefied and passes out into the
current of the circulating fluids. As before stated, the organized
proteid as such is never decomposed; it must first
enter into solution, and then under the influence of the living
cells it undergoes disruption in the same manner as the circulating
proteid. It is thus evident that the tissue cells and
the circulating fluids permeating them bear an ever changing
relationship to each other. Excess of circulating proteid will
be attended by increased katabolism, while at the same time
there may be some accumulation of proteid in the cells, and
indeed some conversion into organized proteid. During fasting,
hunger, or with an insufficient intake of proteid food,
the current will naturally be in the opposite direction, and
organized proteid will slowly, but surely, be drawn upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>Again, we may ask in view of these facts, of what real use
to the body is this large katabolism of circulating proteid?
We can easily understand the need of proteid to supply the
loss incidental to the breaking down of organized or true
tissue proteid, but this we are led to believe is very small
in amount. Is there any real need for proteid beyond this
requirement? The physiological fuel value of proteid is no
greater than that of carbohydrate and considerably less than
half that of fat, consequently there is on the surface no
apparent reason why proteid should be used for its energy
value in preference to the non-nitrogenous foodstuffs. Further,
as we have seen, the energy of muscle work comes
mainly, at least, from the breaking down of fat and carbohydrate;
proteid, in the case of the well-nourished individual,
ordinarily playing no part in this important line of energy
exchange. Lastly, in the katabolism of proteid there is
the large proportion of nitrogenous matter to be split off and
disposed of before the carbon moiety of the molecule can be
rendered available. Here, we have involved not only a loss
of energy, but in addition a certain amount of what appears
to be useless labor thrown upon the liver, kidneys, and other
organs. Is there any wonder that the thoughtful physiologist,
looking at the facts and theories presented by the Voit
conception of proteid katabolism, should ask wherein lies the
value to the body of this high rate of metabolism of circulating
proteid, a rate of metabolism which is seemingly governed
primarily by the amount of proteid food ingested?</p>

<p>Turning next to Pflüger’<span class="nowrap">s<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> views regarding proteid katabolism,
we find a totally different outlook. Here, the supposition
prevails that the plasma of the blood and lymph, with
its contained proteid, is the food of the organs or their cells,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
but that before this food material can undergo katabolism it
must first be absorbed by the cell and built up into the living
protoplasm of the tissue. In other words, according to the
views expressed by Pflüger, katabolism must be preceded by
organization of the proteid. Expressed in still different
language, the proteid material circulating in blood and
lymph must be eaten up by the hungry cells and, by appropriate
anabolic processes, made an integral part of the living
protoplasm before disassimilation can occur. Further, according
to Pflüger’s conception of these processes, there is a
radical difference in the chemical nature of living protoplasm
as compared with that of the so-called circulating proteid.
The latter is looked upon as being comparatively stable, resisting
oxidation in high degree, and hence not prone to
undergo metabolism. Living protoplasm, on the other hand,
is characterized by instability, suffering oxidation with the
greatest ease, and hence readily broken down in the ordinary
processes of katabolism. Assuming for the moment the correctness
of this theory, we see at a glance that all disruption
of proteid matter in the body must be preceded by the upbuilding
of the proteid into living protoplasm. There can
be no destruction of proteid until the latter has been raised
to the high plane of living matter. The dead, inert circulating
proteid can serve simply as food for the living cells, and
cannot undergo katabolism until it has been built up into the
organized structure of the tissue or organ. Even though we
grant that a small proportion of proteid may suffer katabolism
without previous organization, it does not materially modify
the general trend of the argument that, according to Pflüger’s
hypothesis, proteid katabolism is essentially a process involving
the disruption of living protoplasm.</p>

<p>Consider what this means in the light of facts already
presented. Remembering that the one factor above all others
influencing the rate of proteid katabolism is the amount of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
proteid food taken in, and that the output of nitrogen, no
matter what the previous condition of the body or the
amount of proteid food ingested, runs more or less parallel
with the consumption of proteid, we are forced to the conclusion,
in accepting this hypothesis, that there must be
superhuman activity in the building up of living protoplasm,
only to be followed, however, by its immediate and more or
less complete breaking down. Further, think of the daily
or periodical fluctuation in the construction of bioplasm,
coincident with variations in the amount of proteid food
consumed, and the corresponding destruction of bioplasm
as indicated by the daily output of nitrogen. Imagine,
if you will, the concrete case of a man of 70 kilos body-weight
eating a daily ration containing 125 grams of proteid,
the nitrogen equivalent of which is practically excreted
within twenty-four hours, and are we not wise in hesitating
to believe that all of that proteid has been so quickly
built up into living or organized tissue only to be immediately
broken down and thrown out of the body? Think
of the enormous activity implied in the manufacture of this
bioplasm in the time allotted, and for what? Apparently,
so that it can be broken down again. But such energy as
is liberated in the breaking-down process might be derived
far more economically by simple destruction of the proteid,
as contained in the meshes of the tissue elements, without
assuming a preliminary conversion into living protoplasm.
Obviously, we have here a theory which does not help us in
arriving at any very satisfactory conception of proteid metabolism.
The facts which Pflüger and his followers bring
forward in support of the theory are not very convincing, or
at least not sufficiently so to carry conviction in the face of
a natural disinclination to believe in the necessity of such a
profound anabolic process, merely as a prelude to the speedy
destruction of the finished product. Finally, we may add<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
that if all proteid katabolized in the body must first be raised
to the high level of living protoplasm before the final disruption
can occur, it may be prudent to keep the daily intake
of this foodstuff down to a level somewhat commensurate
with the real needs of the body.</p>

<p>As has been stated many times in the course of this presentation,
the most striking feature of proteid metabolism is
the rapidity with which large quantities of proteid consumed
as food are broken down, and the contained nitrogen eliminated
from the body as urea. A few hours will suffice to
accomplish the more or less complete destruction of food
proteid; and any theory of proteid metabolism, to be at all
satisfactory, must explain this peculiar phenomenon. According
to recent investigations, it seems probable that some, at
least, of the cleavage products of proteid formed during intestinal
digestion are not built up into new proteid, but are at
once eliminated mainly in the form of urea, without becoming
a part of either the so-called circulating proteid, or the living
protoplasm of the body. It will be recalled that under the
influence of the digestive enzymes, trypsin and erepsin, proteid
foodstuffs may be broken down while undergoing intestinal
digestion into monamino- and diamino-acids, such
as leucin, tyrosin, arginin, lysin, etc. A certain proportion
of these comparatively simple substances may be directly
absorbed by the portal circulation and carried to the liver,
where they may undergo conversion into urea. In this way,
some portion of the nitrogen of the ingested food may be
quickly eliminated from the system. As has been stated in
another connection, we are not sure at present how far proteid
decomposition of the kind indicated takes place normally
in the body. We merely know that there are present in the
intestine, enzymes capable of splitting up proteid into these
small fragments, and that substances of this type when made
to circulate through the liver are transformed into urea. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
facts, coupled with the well-known tendency of the nitrogen
of proteid food to appear in the excretions a few hours after
the food in question has been consumed, naturally suggests
a direct breaking down of proteid along the lines indicated,
with a possible retention of a carbonaceous residue (nitrogen-free)
for subsequent oxidation, as a source of energy for heat
or work. Obviously, all of the proteid food cannot behave
in this manner, for if such were the case there would be no
proteid available for making good the normal waste incidental
to tissue changes. Either a certain amount of proteid escapes
this profound alteration produced by the proteolytic
enzymes in question, or else a certain proportion of these
simple decomposition products is synthesized in the intestine,
or in the tissues of the body, to form new proteid for the
regeneration of cell protoplasm. However this may be, we
have presented in this view a plausible explanation of the
prompt appearance of food nitrogen in the excretions, and
without compelling belief in a theory, such as Pflüger’s,
which taxes one’s credulity to the utmost. To be sure, as a
prominent writer on physiology has recently said, such a view
stands opposed to our conceptions of the importance of proteid
food; but it seems possible, in the light of accumulating
knowledge, that our conceptions of the part played by proteid
foods in the nutrition of man have not been strictly logical,
or quite in accord with true physiological reasoning.</p>

<p>Again, in this connection, we may ask the question, why is
it that the body provides such an effective method for the
speedy breaking down of proteid food and the prompt elimination
of the contained nitrogen? Whatever the means made
use of by the organism in accomplishing this, the result is the
same; the nitrogen of the ingested food is, in large measure,
quickly gotten rid of. We clearly recognize the all-important
position of proteid foods in the nutrition of the body, but
there appears a certain inconsistency in this prompt removal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
of the nitrogen-containing portion of the proteid molecule.
The nitrogenous part of the proteid food is, physiologically
considered, the all-important part. It is the only source of
nitrogen available to the system, and yet apparently the larger
proportion of this nitrogenous material is not utilized in any
recognizable way, but is eliminated as quickly as possible. Is
it not within the limits of possibility that these methods,
whatever may be the exact mechanism involved, are merely
a means of getting rid of a surplus of proteid for which the
body has no real need? This question I shall try to answer
later on in another connection, but we may advantageously
keep this possibility in mind while we are discussing these
theories of proteid metabolism.</p>

<p>It is obvious, in the light of present knowledge, that there
must be a certain amount of true tissue proteid broken down
each day, independent of that larger metabolism coincident
with the intake of proteid food. However much this more
voluminous proteid katabolism may fluctuate, owing to variations
in the intake of proteid, and whatever the significance of
this latter phase of metabolism, it is self-evident that there
must be a steady, constant metabolism, upon which the life
of the various tissues and organs of the body depends, and by
which the proteid integrity of the tissue cells is maintained.
This implies a certain degree of true tissue change, in which
definite amounts of proteid material are broken down and
the resultant loss made good from the proteid intake. No
matter what specific name be applied to this form of proteid
katabolism, its existence is clearly recognized. It is obviously
a form of metabolism distinct, and probably quite
different, from that form, more variable in extent, which is
associated with the intake of proteid food. Plainly, if there
is truth in these statements, there should be some data available
by means of which these two lines of proteid katabolism
can be more or less sharply differentiated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>Thanks especially to the work of Folin<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> these data are now
apparently at hand, and the facts which he has accumulated
with painstaking care seem destined to throw additional
light upon our conception of proteid metabolism. It will
be remembered that in the breaking down of proteid, the
great bulk of its contained nitrogen is eliminated in the
form of urea. In addition, a certain smaller amount of nitrogen
is excreted in the forms of creatinin and uric acid.
As we have seen, the total output of nitrogen, which measures
the extent to which proteid is decomposed in the body,
varies with the intake of proteid food; but it is found that
the proportion of nitrogen excreted in the forms of urea and
uric acid varies with the extent of the metabolism. In other
words, quantitative changes in the daily proteid katabolism
are accompanied by pronounced changes in the distribution
of the excreted nitrogen. Let us take a single illustration
from Folin’s results; the case of a healthy man who on one
day&mdash;July 13&mdash;consumed a proteid-rich diet, and on the
other day&mdash;July 20&mdash;was living on a diet containing only
about 1 gram of nitrogen. The composition of the excretion
through the kidneys on these two days is shown in the
following table:</p>

</div>

<p>Here we see, as would be expected, that on the high proteid
diet, there was a large excretion of total nitrogen and of
urea; while on the low proteid diet, nitrogen and urea were
correspondingly diminished. The point to attract our attention,
however, is the marked difference in the percentage of
urea-nitrogen in the two cases; a difference which amounts
to about 26 per cent. A similar difference is to be noted in
the percentage of uric acid-nitrogen. Lastly, it is to be observed
that in spite of the great difference in the extent of
metabolism on the two days&mdash;an excretion of 16.8 grams
of nitrogen, as contrasted with 3.6 grams&mdash;the <i>amount</i> of
creatinin-nitrogen is essentially the same. Folin finds that
these peculiarities in the percentage distribution of excreted
nitrogen hold good in all cases where there is this wide
divergence in the amount of proteid katabolized, and, further,
that there is a gradual and regular transition from the
one extreme to the other. He sees in these results evidence
that there are in the body two forms of proteid katabolism,
essentially independent and quite different. One kind is
extremely variable in quantity, while the other tends to remain
constant. The variable form has its own particular
kind of waste products, of which urea is the chief. The
constant katabolism, on the other hand, is largely represented
by creatinin and to a lesser degree by uric acid. The
more the total katabolism is reduced, the more prominent
become creatinin and uric acid, products of the constant
katabolism; while urea, as chief representative of the variable
katabolism, becomes less conspicuous. Folin suggests the
term <i>endogenous</i> or <i>tissue</i> metabolism for the constant variety,
while the variable form he would name <i>exogenous</i> or <i>intermediate</i>
metabolism.</p>

<p>In these suggestions we have not theory only, but a
number of very important facts which plainly must have
some significance. Take, for example, the excretion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
creatinin. It is a characteristic nitrogenous waste product,
but its elimination from the body is wholly independent
of quantitative changes in the total amount of nitrogen
excreted. In other words, the amount of creatinin eliminated
is a constant quantity for a given individual under
ordinary conditions, no matter how great the variation in the
amount of proteid food, provided no meat is eaten. Meat
must be avoided in testing this point, since meat contains a
certain amount of creatin, or other components, which would
be excreted as creatinin. Further, it is found that every individual
has his own specific creatinin excretion, which fact
again emphasizes the idea that this substance is a product of
true tissue katabolism, having no connection with that variable
metabolism, of which urea is the striking representative.
These are facts which cannot be ignored. They are well
established by the careful observations of Folin, and they are
confirmed by a large number of observations made in our
own laboratory. Turn now to that other, more conspicuous,
product of proteid katabolism, urea. With a so-called average
proteid intake, about 88–90 per cent of the excreted
nitrogen will be in the form of urea, but, as Folin states,
“with every decided diminution in the quantity of total
nitrogen eliminated, there is a pronounced reduction in the
per cent of that nitrogen represented by urea. When the
daily total nitrogen elimination has been reduced to 3 grams
or 4 grams, about 60 per cent of it only is in the form of
urea.” Here, we have the chief product of exogenous metabolism,
a substance quite distinct from creatinin, just as the
process by which it originates is likewise quite distinct.</p>

<p>Exogenous metabolism is plainly a process of quite a different
order from that of endogenous, or tissue metabolism.
The latter involves oxidation, while the former consists essentially
of a series of hydrolytic cleavages which result in a
rapid elimination of the proteid-nitrogen as urea. In this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
conception of exogenous katabolism, we have essentially the
same viewpoint as was previously taken in attempting to
explain how excess of proteid food can be so quickly decomposed,
and its nitrogen removed from the body. Whether
the hydrolytic cleavage is accomplished solely by trypsin and
erepsin, whether it takes place only in the intestine and in the
liver, or whether other glands and tissues are involved, is at
present immaterial; the essential point is that we have in the
body a variety of proteid katabolism, quite different from true
tissue katabolism, the extent of which is dependent primarily
upon the amount of proteid food consumed. The process involved
is one which aims at the rapid removal of the proteid-nitrogen
as urea; without incorporation of the absorbed
proteid, or its decomposition products, either as an integral
or adherent part of the tissue proteid. Hydrolytic cleavage
is eminently fitted to accomplish this with the least expenditure
of energy, while the carbonaceous residue of the proteid
thus freed from nitrogen can be transformed into carbohydrate,
or directly oxidized as the needs of the body demand.</p>

<p>As one considers these views so admirably worked out by
Folin, the question naturally arises, if the real demands of
the body for proteid food will not be adequately met by the
quantity necessary to satisfy the true tissue metabolism?
We may well believe, with Folin, that “only a small amount
of proteid, namely, that necessary for the endogenous metabolism,
is needed. The greater part of the proteid furnished
with so-called standard diets, like Voit’s, <i>i. e.</i>, that part representing
the exogenous metabolism, is not needed; or, to
be more specific, its nitrogen is not needed. The organism
has developed special facilities for getting rid of such excess of
nitrogen, so as to get the use of the carbonaceous part of the
proteid containing it.” In endogenous metabolism, we have
a steady, constant process quite independent of the amount
of proteid food, and absolutely indispensable for the maintenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
of life. So far as we know at present, its representative
creatinin is, for a given individual, the same in amount
during fasting as when a rich, meat-free, proteid diet is taken.
The one factor that seemingly determines the amount of
creatinin eliminated is the weight of the individual, or more
exactly the weight of the true tissue elements of the body, as
distinct from fat or adipose tissue. Endogenous or tissue
katabolism obviously calls for a certain quantity of proteid
to maintain equilibrium, but this is small in amount as compared
with the usual intake of proteid foods. The average
man, with his ordinary dietetic habits, consumes more nitrogen
than the body can possibly make use of. The excess is
not stored up, “because the actual need of nitrogen is so small
that an excess is always furnished with the food, except, of
course, in carefully planned experiments” (Folin).</p>

<p>We have seen at what low levels of proteid intake, nitrogen
equilibrium can be established, and we may well have faith
in the conception of an endogenous proteid katabolism which
involves only minimal quantities of proteid. Further, we
have observed the constant tendency of the body to maintain
a condition of nitrogenous equilibrium, even with varying
income, and how slow the body is to lay by nitrogen on a
rich proteid diet, even when long deprived of proteid food;
a fact difficult of explanation except on the assumption that
the real need of the body for nitrogen is small, and that the
tissues habitually carry a relatively large reserve of nitrogenous
material. We may assume with Folin that “all the living
protoplasm in the animal organism is suspended in a fluid
very rich in proteid, and on account of the habitual use of
more nitrogenous food than the tissues can use as proteid the
organism is ordinarily in possession of approximately the
maximum amount of reserved proteid in solution that it can
advantageously retain. When the supply of food proteid is
stopped, the excess of reserve proteid inside the organism is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
still sufficient to cause a rather large destruction of proteid
during the first day or two of proteid starvation, and after that
the proteid katabolism is very small, provided sufficient non-nitrogenous
food is available. But even then, and for many
days thereafter, the protoplasm of the tissues has still an
abundant supply of dissolved proteid, and the normal activity
of such tissues as the muscles is not at all impaired or
diminished. When 30 grams or 40 grams of nitrogen have
been lost by an average-sized man during a week or more of
abstinence from nitrogenous food the living muscle tissues
are still well supplied with all the proteid they can use.
That this is so, is indicated on the one hand by the unchanged
creatinin elimination, and on the other by the fact
that one experiences no feeling of unusual fatigue or of inability
to do one’s customary work. Because the organism
at the end of such an experiment still has an abundance of
available proteid in the nutritive fluids, it is at once seemingly
wasteful with nitrogen when a return is made to nitrogenous
food. This is why it only gradually, and only under
the prolonged pressure of an excessive supply of food-proteid
again acquires its original maximum store of this reserve
material.”</p>

<p>We may reasonably suppose that the reserve of proteid
present in the body is contained in the fluid media, and not
as a part of the living protoplasm. Further, we are apparently
justified in the belief that the sole form of proteid
katabolism which is vitally important for the welfare of the
body is the endogenous katabolism. This must be provided
for adequately and indeed liberally, and in addition there
should be sufficient intake to keep up an abundant supply of
reserve proteid, but beyond these necessities there would
seem to be no legitimate demand for additional proteid. The
voluminous exogenous proteid katabolism so conspicuous in
most individuals would seem to have no justification in fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
or in physiological reasoning. What good, for example, can
be accomplished by this constant splitting off of nitrogen,
with its subsequent speedy removal from the body? The
organism can neither use it nor store it up, and why therefore
should this daily burden of an excessive and accelerated
proteid katabolism be borne? As we have seen, the energy
of muscle work is derived mainly, and can come wholly, from
the breaking down of non-nitrogenous materials, fats and
carbohydrates. The very fact that an intake of say 120
grams of proteid is followed at once by the removal of the
larger part of the contained nitrogen, as a result of the exogenous
katabolism of the body, would seemingly warrant
the view that the proteid so decomposed might advantageously
be replaced by a corresponding amount of carbohydrate. In
muscle work, as in heat production, carbohydrate and fat are
the materials burned up, or oxidized. Proteid, on the other
hand, is not so oxidized, at least not the nitrogen-containing
portion of the molecule.</p>

<p>There are apparent only two possible reasons for assuming
a need on the part of the body for the high exogenous
katabolism of proteid so commonly observed. The one is
that the carbonaceous residue left after the cleavage of nitrogen
from the proteid molecule is better adapted for the
needs of the body than either carbohydrate or fat. Although
this does not seem very probable, it is of course a possibility
and merits consideration. Feeding experiments, with a comparatively
small proteid intake, continued over a sufficient
length of time, would show conclusively how much weight
should be attached to this hypothesis. The other possibility
is that the body may derive some advantage from the presence,
in the tissues and fluids, of the varied nitrogenous
cleavage products split off from proteid so abundantly in
exogenous katabolism. These substances are mainly amino-acids
on their way to urea, and there is no apparent reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
why they should be of service to the organism. Still, the
processes going on in the tissues and organs of the body are
intricate and not wholly understood, and we can conceive of
some useful function of which as yet we have no knowledge.
In the construction of tissue proteid, for example, as in a
possible synthesis out of the fragments formed by hydrolytic
cleavage, it is not impossible that certain corner-stones are
needed, and that in order to obtain these there must be
a more or less wasteful breaking down of food-proteid.
However improbable this may seem, it, like the preceding
hypothesis, can be tested in a way by adequate feeding experiments,
which shall determine the effect on the body
of a low proteid intake continued over a long period of time.
On the other hand, it is equally plausible, and for some
reasons more probable, to assume that this excessive exogenous
katabolism may be in a measure prejudicial to the
best interests of the body; that the many nitrogenous fragments
formed in the efforts of the organism to prevent
undue accumulation of reserve proteid may in the long run
do as much harm as good.</p>

<p>Further, there is reason in the question whether the continual
carrying of excessive amounts of nitrogen reserves in
the shape of soluble proteid in the blood and lymph, and in
the meshes of tissue and cell protoplasm, is advantageous for
the maintenance of the highest degree of efficiency? We all
recognize that an excessive accumulation of fat is distinctly
disadvantageous to the welfare of the body, and there is,
physiologically speaking, equally good ground for considering
that the storage of unorganized proteid in amounts beyond
all possible requirements of the body may be equally undesirable.
Because less tangible to the eye, the accumulation
of unnecessary proteid is not so easily recognizable, but
this fact does not diminish the possible danger which such
accumulation may constitute. It must be granted, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
that we are dealing here with hypotheses and not facts, but
though hypothetical the suggestions made are of sufficient
moment to merit attention and experimental study. In a
later chapter, we shall have occasion to present some facts
bearing on these questions.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we may lay due stress upon the significance
of these views regarding proteid katabolism. We
must accept as settled the general idea that there are two
distinct forms of proteid katabolism within the body; one
form representing the decay of tissue or cell protoplasm,
small in amount, with its own particular decomposition products,
and absolutely essential for the continuance of life.
The other form, the so-called exogenous katabolism, runs a
totally different course with distinctive side-products and
end-products; it is variable in extent, in harmony with
variations in proteid intake, and subject to the suspicion
that at the level ordinarily maintained it constitutes a menace
to the preservation of that high degree of efficiency which
is an attribute of good health.</p>

<p>Having acquired information regarding the principles
of metabolism and the general laws governing the
nutrition of the body, we may next consider briefly the
dietetic habits of mankind, with a view to learning how
far such habits coincide with actual nutritive requirements.
Eventually, we shall need to ask the questions: What are the
<i>true</i> nutritive requirements of the body? How much food
and what kinds of food does the ordinary individual doing
an average amount of work need each day in order to preserve
body equilibrium, and to maintain health, strength, and
vigor under the varying conditions of life? What amount
of nitrogen or proteid, and what the total calorific value<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
required to supply the physiological needs of the body?
How closely do the so-called “normal diets” and “standard
diets,” which have met with such general acceptance, conform
to a rational conception of true physiological needs?
These are vital questions of great physiological and economic
importance, and they are not easily answered; but theoretical
considerations based on scientific data, and experimental
evidence combined with practical experience, should point
the way to some very definite conclusions.</p>

<p>Observations made in many countries regarding the dietetic
customs and habits of the people have resulted in the establishment
of certain dietary standards, which have been more
or less generally adopted as representing the requirements of
the body. As a prelude to the discussion of this question,
let us consider briefly some of the results of these dietary
studies. In Sweden, laborers doing hard work were found
by Hultgren and Landergren to consume daily, on an average,
189 grams of proteid, 714 grams of carbohydrate, and
110 grams of fat, with a total fuel value for the day’s ration
of 4726 large calories. In Russia, workmen at moderately
hard labor, having perfect freedom of choice in their food,
were found by Erisman to take daily 132 grams of proteid,
584 grams of carbohydrate, and 79 grams of fat, this ration
having a fuel value of 3675 calories. In Germany, soldiers
in active service consumed daily, according to Voit, 145
grams of proteid, 500 grams of carbohydrate, and 100 grams
of fat, with a fuel value of 3574 calories. In Italy, laborers
doing a moderate amount of work were found by Lichtenfelt
to consume daily 115 grams of proteid, 696 grams of carbohydrate,
and 26 grams of fat, with a fuel value of 3655 calories.
In France, Gautier states that the ordinary laborer working
eight hours a day must have 135 grams of proteid, 700 grams
of carbohydrate, and 90 grams of fat daily, with a fuel value
of 4260 calories. In England, weavers were found to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
daily 151 grams of proteid, with carbohydrates and fats sufficient
to make the total fuel value of the day’s ration equal
to 3475 calories. In Austria, farm laborers consumed daily
159 grams of proteid, with carbohydrates and fats sufficient
to raise the fuel value of the food to 5096 calories.</p>

<p>Observations of this order might be multiplied indefinitely,
but the above will suffice to give a general idea of the average
food consumption of European peoples doing a moderate
amount of work. These data, however, must be supplemented
by the observations made in our own country, which have been
very extensive, through the “investigations on the nutrition
of man in the United States,” carried on by the Office of Experiment
Stations in the Department of Agriculture, under
the efficient leadership of Atwater. As stated by Messrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Langworthy and Milner, in an official bulletin issued in 1904,
dietary studies of the actual food consumption of people of
different classes in different parts of the United States have
been made during the years 1894 to 1904 on about 15,000
persons,&mdash;men, women, and children,&mdash;as a result of which
it is indicated that “the actual food requirements of persons
under different conditions of life and work” vary from 100
to 175 grams of proteid per day, with a total fuel value ranging
from 2700 to 5500 calories. For comparison, the various
data may be tabulated as shown on page&nbsp;<a href="#Page_155">155</a>.</p>

<p>These figures by no means represent maximum food consumption.
Thus, studies have been made on fifty Maine
lumbermen<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span> where the intake of proteid food averaged 185
grams per day, with a total fuel value of 6400 calories.
Further, dietary studies of university boat <span class="nowrap">crews<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> have shown
fairly high results. The Yale University crew, while at
Gales Ferry, averaged per man during seven days 171 grams
of proteid, 171 grams of fat, and 434 grams of carbohydrate,
with a total fuel value of 4070 calories per day. The members
of the Harvard University crew showed an average
daily consumption of 160 grams of proteid, 170 grams of
fat, and 448 grams of carbohydrate, with a total fuel value
of 4074 calories. It is also reported that a football team of
college students in the University of California consumed
daily, per man, 270 grams of proteid, 416 grams of fat, and
710 grams of carbohydrate, with a total fuel value of 7885
calories. These figures may be contrasted, however, with the
data obtained in a study of the dietary habits of fourteen professional
men’s families, where the average amount of proteid
consumed daily was 104 grams, fat 125 grams, and carbohydrate
423 grams, with a total fuel value of 3325 calories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>Leaving out of consideration the extremes given, it is
undoubtedly true that, within certain rather wide limits,
there is an apparent tendency for people of different nations,
having a free choice of food and not restricted by expense,
to consume daily approximately the same amounts of nutrients;
to use what may be called liberal rather than small
amounts of food; and, lastly, to consume food somewhat in
proportion to the amount of work done. It is perhaps, therefore,
not strange that students of nutrition should have taken
these results, obtained by the statistical method, as indicating
the actual needs of the body for food, and that so-called
“standard diets” and “normal diets” should have been constructed,
based upon these and corresponding data. Thus,
we have the widely adopted “Voit standard,” composed of
proteid 118 grams, carbohydrate 500 grams, and fat 56
grams, with a total fuel value of 3055 calories, as the amount
of food required daily by a man of 70 kilos body-weight
doing a moderate amount of work. These figures were obtained
by Voit as an average of the food consumption of a
large number of laboring men in Germany, and they carried
additional weight because at that time Voit and others
thought they had evidence that nitrogenous equilibrium
could not be maintained for any length of time on smaller
amounts of proteid.</p>

<p>The figures given in the preceding table under the head
of American subjects constitute the “Atwater standards,”
and as already indicated, are based upon the dietetic habits
of over 15,000 persons under different conditions of life and
physical activity. In the words of the official Bulletin, these
standards covering the quantities of food per day “are intended
to show the actual food requirements of persons
under different conditions of life and work.” Here, however,
lies an assumption which seems to meet with wide
acceptance, but for which it is difficult to conceive any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
logical reason. The thousands of dietary studies made on
peoples all over the world, affording more or less accurate
information regarding the average amounts of proteid, fat,
and carbohydrate consumed under varying conditions, are indeed
most interesting and important, as affording information
regarding dietetic customs and habits; but, the writer
fails to see any reason why such data need be assumed
to throw any light on the actual food requirements of the
body. In the words of another, “Food should be ingested in
just the proper amount to repair the waste of the body; to
furnish it with the energy it needs for work and warmth;
to maintain it in vigor; and, in the case of immature animals,
to provide the proper excess for normal growth, in order to
be of the most advantage to the body” (Benedict).</p>

<p>Any habitual excess of food, over and above what is really
needed to meet the actual wants of the body, is not only
uneconomical, but may be distinctly disadvantageous. Voit,
among others, has clearly emphasized the general principle
that the smallest amount of proteid, with non-nitrogenous
food added, that will suffice to keep the body in a state of
continual vigor is the ideal diet. My own conception of the
true food requirements of the body has been expressed in the
statement that man needs of proteids, fats, and carbohydrates
sufficient to establish and maintain physiological and nitrogen
equilibrium; sufficient to keep up that strength of body and
mind that is essential to good health, to maintain the highest
degree of physical and mental activity with the smallest
amount of friction and the least expenditure of energy, and
to preserve and heighten, if possible, the ordinary resistance
of the body to disease germs. The smallest amount of food
that will accomplish these ends is, I think, the ideal diet.
There must truly be enough to supply the real needs of the
body, but any great surplus over and above what is actually
called for may in the long run prove an undesirable addition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
With these thoughts in mind, may we not reasonably ask
why it should be assumed that there is any tangible connection
between the dietetic habits of a people and their true
physiological needs?</p>

<p>Arguments predicated on custom, habit, and usage have
no physiological basis that appeals strongly to the impartial
observer. Man is a creature of habits; he is quick to acquire
new ones when his environment affords the opportunity, and
he is prone to cling to old ones when they minister to his
sense of taste. The argument that because the people of a
country, constituting a given class, eat a certain amount of
proteid food daily, the quantity so consumed must be an
indication of the amount needed to meet the requirements
of the body, is as faulty as the argument that because people
of a given community are in the habit of consuming a certain
amount of wine each day at dinner their bodies must necessarily
be in need of the stimulant, and that consequently
alcohol is a true physiological requirement. A large proportion
of mankind is addicted to the tobacco habit, and to
many persons the after-dinner cigar is as essential to comfort
as the dinner itself; but would any one think of arguing that
tobacco is one of the physiological needs of the body?</p>

<p>It is said that dietary studies made all over the civilized
world “show that a moderately liberal quantity of protein is
demanded by communities occupying leading positions in the
world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It certainly seems more than a remarkable coincidence
that peoples varying so widely in regard to nationality,
climatic and geographical conditions, and dietetic habits,
should show such agreement in respect to consumption of
protein and energy.” Again, we hear it said that “whatever
may be true of a few individuals, with communities a
generally low condition of mental and physical efficiency,
thrift, and commercial success, is coincident with a low proportion
of protein in the diet.” The writer, however, fails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
to find evidence in the results afforded by dietary studies
that there is any causal relationship between the amount of
proteid food consumed and the mental or physical supremacy
of the people of a given nation or community. Cause and
effect are liable to become reversed in arguments of this
kind. It is certainly just as plausible to assume that increase
in the consumption of proteid follows in the footsteps
of commercial and other forms of prosperity, as to argue
that prosperity or mental and physical development are the
result of an increased intake of proteid food.</p>

<p>Proteid foods are usually costly, and the ability of a community
to indulge freely in this form of dietetic luxury
depends in large measure upon its commercial prosperity.
The palate is an extremely sensitive organ, and the average
individual properly derives great satisfaction from the pleasurable
effects of tasty articles of food. Furthermore, there
are many curious and quite unphysiological notions abroad
regarding foods, which tend to incite persons to unnecessary
excess and extravagance whenever they acquire the means
to do so. The latter point is well illustrated by the more
or less prevalent opinion that a cut of tenderloin steak is
more nutritious than a cut of round steak. It is true that
the former is apt to be more tender, to have a little finer
flavor; but the round steak, when properly prepared, is just
as nutritious, and equally capable of meeting the needs of
the body, as the more expensive tenderloin. With increasing
prosperity, we turn at once, as a rule, to the more tasty
and appetizing viands, partly to satisfy the craving of appetite
and palate, and partly because there is an inherent belief
that these varied delicacies, accessible to the prosperous community,
count as an aid to health and strength. The poor
laborer, with his small wage, is restricted to a certain low
level of dietary variety, and must likewise be economical as
to quantity, but on the first opportunity afforded by a fuller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
purse he is apt to pass from corned beef to a fresh roast with
its more appetizing flavor; to eschew brown bread in favor of
the white loaf, and in many other ways to evince his desire
for a dietary which, though perhaps no more nutritious, appeals
because of its finer flavor, more appetizing appearance,
and greater variety. He is in the same position as the
smoker who, limited by his purse to a five-cent cigar after
dinner, quickly passes to a cigar of better flavor as soon as
his finances warrant the indulgence. At the same time, if
prosperity continues, our laborer will speedily pass to a
higher level of proteid intake and greater fuel value, through
increased consumption of meat and butter, together with
other articles rich in proteid and fat.</p>

<p>In this connection, we may emphasize a fact of some
significance in its bearing on dietetic customs; viz., that
ever since Liebig advanced his theory that proteid material
is the sole source of muscular energy, there has been a deep-rooted
belief that meat is the most efficient kind of food for
keeping up the strength of the body, and hence especially
demanded by all whose work is mainly physical. Although
this view, as we have seen, has been thoroughly disproved,
the idea is still more or less generally held that an abundance
of meat is a necessary requisite for a good day’s work,
a view which undoubtedly accounts in some measure for the
tendency toward a high proteid intake, evinced by many of
the laboring class whose means will permit the necessary
outlay.</p>

<p>Increased consumption of proteid food may be coincident
with thrift and commercial success, but there is no justification
for the belief that these are the result of changed dietary
conditions. The dietary of our New England forefathers
was, according to all accounts, exceedingly limited as compared
with that of to-day, but it is doubtful if the present
generation is any better developed, physically or mentally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
than the stalwart and vigorous people who opened up this
country to civilization. To-day, as a nation, we have
greater wealth, and our commercial prosperity has become
phenomenal; but would any one think for a moment that
these characteristics are attributable to the large consumption
of proteid food so common to this generation of the
American people? No, increased wealth simply paves the
way for greater freedom in the choice of food; increased commercial
success and business prosperity throw open avenues
which formerly were closed; greater variety of animal foods,
and vegetable foods as well, rich in proteid, are made easily
accessible, and appeal to eye and palate on all sides; appetite
and craving for food are abnormally stimulated, and dietetic
habits and customs change accordingly. In the words of
another, “the one thing that primitive, barbarous, and civilized
man alike long for is an abundance of the ‘flesh-pots of
Egypt.’ The very first use the latter makes of his increased
power and financial resources is to buy new, rare, and expensive
kinds of meat.” With these facts before us, it is difficult
to accept the assumption that dietetic customs afford any
indication of the food requirements of the body. To the
physiologist such a view does not appeal, since there is a
lack of any scientific evidence that carries conviction.</p>

<p>But it may be asked, is not appetite a safe guide to follow?
Do not the cravings of the stomach and the so-called pangs
of hunger merit consideration? Is it not the part of wisdom
to follow inclination in the choice and quantity of our food?
Can we not safely rely upon these factors as an index of
the real needs of the body? If these questions are to be
answered in the affirmative, then it is plain that a study of
dietetic customs will tell us definitely how much food and
what kinds of food are required daily to supply the true
wants of the body. There are writers who claim that instinct
is a perfectly safe guide to follow; that it is far superior to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
reason; but it is to be noticed that most of these writers, if
they have any physiological knowledge to draw upon, are
sooner or later prone to admit that the body has certain definite
needs which it is the purpose of food to supply, with
the added implication that any surplus of food over and
above what is necessary to meet these demands is entirely
uncalled for. Thus, one such writer states that “the man in
the street follows his God-given instincts and plods peacefully
along to his three square meals a day, consisting of
anything he can find in the market, and just as much of it
as he can afford, with special preference for rich meats, fats,
and sugars.” Yet this same writer, a little later, emphasizes
the fact that “every particle of the energy which sparkles
in our eyes, which moves our muscles, which warms our imaginations,
is sunlight cunningly woven into our food by the
living cell, whether vegetable or animal. Every movement,
every word, every thought, every aspiration represents the
expenditure of precisely so much energy derived from food.”
Why, then, would it not be wise to ascertain how much
energy is so expended, on an average, during the day’s activity
and govern the intake of food accordingly? Why not apply
an intelligent supervision in place of following an instinct
which, in the words of the author just quoted, leads one on
to consume “anything he can find in the market and just as
much of it as he can afford”? Truly, if dietetic customs
and the habits of mankind are the results of instinct working
in this fashion, there cannot be much value in the data
obtained by observing the quantities of food mankind is in
the habit of eating. Dietary standards based on such observations
must be open to the suspicion of representing
values far above the actual needs of the body.</p>

<p>Habits and cravings are certainly very unreliable indices
of true physiological requirements. Man is constantly acquiring
new habits, and these in time become second nature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
forcing him to practise that which he has become accustomed
to, regardless of whether it is beneficial or otherwise. The
celebrated philosopher, John Locke, in his essay on education,
says: “I do not think all people’s appetites are alike&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
but this I think, that many are made gourmands and
gluttons by custom, that were not so by nature; and I see
in some countries, men as lusty and strong, that eat but two
meals a day, as others that have set their stomachs by a constant
usage, like Larums, to call on them for four or five.”
Again, the so-called cravings of appetite are largely artificial
and mainly the result of habit. A habit once acquired and
persistently followed soon has us in its grasp, and then any
deviation therefrom is very apt to disturb our physiological
equilibrium. The system makes complaint, and we experience
a craving, it may be, for that to which the body has become
accustomed. There has thus come about a sentiment
that the cravings of the appetite for food are to be fully
satisfied, that this is merely obedience to nature’s laws. In
reality, there is no foundation for such a belief; any one with
a little persistence can change his or her habits of life,
change the whole order of cravings, thereby indicating that
the latter are essentially artificial, and that they have no
necessary connection with the welfare or needs of the body.
The man who for some reason deems it advisable to adopt
two meals a day in place of three or four, at first experiences
a certain amount of discomfort, but eventually the new
habit becomes a part of the daily routine, and the man’s
life moves forward as before, with perfect comfort and without
a suggestion of craving, or a pang of hunger. Dietetic
requirements, and standard dietaries, are not to be founded
upon the so-called cravings of appetite and the instinctive
demands for food, but upon reason and intelligence, reinforced
by definite knowledge of the real necessities of the
bodily machinery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>The standards which have been adopted more or less generally
throughout the civilized world, based primarily on the
assumption that man instinctively and independently selects
a diet that is best adapted to his individual needs, are open
to grave suspicion. The view that the average food consumption
of large numbers of individuals and communities must
represent the true nutritive requirements of the people is
equally untenable. Naturally, there is general recognition of
the principle that food requirements are necessarily modified
by a variety of circumstances, such as age, sex, body-weight,
bodily activity, etc. It is obvious that the man of 140 pounds
body-weight needs less proteid than the man of 170 pounds,
and that the man who does a large amount of physical work
demands a larger calorific value in his daily diet, <i>i. e.</i>, more
carbohydrate and fat, than the sedentary individual. The
growing child, in proportion to his body-weight, plainly needs
more proteid for the upbuilding of tissue, and there are many
conditions of disease where special dietetic treatment is undoubtedly
called for. Our contention, however, and one
which we believe to be perfectly justifiable, is that the true
food requirements of the body, under any conditions, cannot
be ascertained with any degree of accuracy by observations of
what people are in the habit of eating; that customs and
habits are not a safe index of true physiological needs. On
the contrary, we are inclined to the belief that direct physiological
experimentation, covering a sufficient length of time
and with an adequate number of individuals, will prove far
more efficient in affording a true estimate of the quality and
quantity of food best adapted for the maintenance of good
health, strength, and vigor.</p>

<p>Before considering these latter points, it is interesting to
note, in passing, that during the last four centuries many
thoughtful men have called attention to the apparent excessive
use of food. There seems to have been in many quarters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
a more or less prevalent opinion that custom and habit were
leading people on to methods of living, which were not in
accord with the best interests of the community. It must be
remembered, however, that arguments of this kind, even fifty
years ago, could have been founded only on general observation
and the application of common sense, since there were
then no sound physiological data on which to predicate an
opinion, or base a conclusion. Still, there were men of
authority who attempted to lay before the people a proper
conception of the temperate use of food. We have not the
time here to consider many of these pleas, but I venture to
call attention to the somewhat celebrated book published by
the physician Thomas Cogan in 1596, under the title “The
Haven of Health,” and dedicated “to the right honorable and
my verie good lord, Sir Edward Seymour, Knight and Earl
of Hertford.” Under the subject of diet, this old-time writer
says: “The second thing that is to be considered of meates is
the quantitie, which ought of all men greatly to be regarded,
for therein lyeth no small occasion of health or sickness, of
life or death. For as want of meate consumeth the very substance
of our flesh, so doth excesse and surfet extinguish and
suffocate naturall heat wherein life consisteth.” Again, “Use
a measure in eating, that thou maist live long: and if thou
wilst be in health, then hold thine hands. But the greatest
occasion why men passe the measure in eating, is varitie of
meats at one meale. Which fault is most common among
us in England farre above all other nations. For such is our
custome by reason of plentie (as I think) that they which be
of abilitie, are served with sundry sortes of meate at one
meale. Yea the more we would welcome our friends the
more dishes we prepare. And when we are well satisfied
with one dish or two, then come other more delicate and procureth
us by that meanes, to eate more than nature doth require.
Thus varietie bringeth us to excesse, and sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
to surfet also. But Phisicke teacheth us to faede moderately
upon one kinde of meate only at one meale, or at leastwise
not upon many of contrarie natures.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This disease, (I
mean surfet) is verie common: for common is that saying
and most true: That more die by surfet than by the sword.
And as Georgius Pictorius saith, all surfet is ill, but of bread
worst of all. And if nature be so strong in many, and they
be not sicke upon a full gorge, yet they are drowsie and
heavie, and more desirous to loyter than to labor, according
to that old maeter, when the belly is full, the bones would
be at rest. Yea the minde and wit is so oppressed and overwhelmed
with excesse that it lyeth as it were drowned for
a time, and unable to use his force.”</p>

<p>Cogan likewise makes some interesting statements regarding
the effects of custom on the consumption of proteid
food, especially meats. Quoting further from this author:
“The fourth thing that is to be considered in meats is
custome. Which is of such force in man’s bodie both in
sicknesse and in health, that it countervaileth nature itselfe,
and is therefore called of Galen in sundry places, an other
nature. Whereof he giveth a notable example, where he
sheweth that an olde woman of Athens used a long time,
to eate Hemlocke (which is a ranke poison) first a little
quantitie, and afterwarde more, till at length she could eate
so much without hurt as would presently poison another.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
So that custome in processe of time may alter nature.”
Finally, we may quote one last saying of Cogan’s, because
of the good sense and wisdom displayed in the sentiment,
as true to-day as when it was written more than three
hundred years ago: “Neither is it good for any man that is
in perfect health, to observe any custome in dyet precisely,
as Arnoldus teacheth upon the same verses in these wordes:
Every man should so order himselfe, that he might be able
to suffer heate and cold, and all motions, and meats necessary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
so as he might change the houres of sleeping and waking,
and his dwelling and lodging without harme: which
thing may be done if we be not too precise in keeping custome,
but otherwise use things unwonted. Which sentence
of Arnoldus agraeth verie well to that of Cornelius Celsus:
He that is sound and in good health, and at libertie, should
bind himselfe to no rules of dyet. To need neither Phisition
or Chirurgion, he must use a diverse order of life, and be
sometimes in the countrie, sometime in the towne, sometimes
hunt, and sometime hawke. But some man may demand of
me how this may agree with that saying of the scholar of
Salernus ‘if you would be free from physicians, let these
three be your physician, a cheerful mind, rest, and a moderate
diet.’ Whereunto I answer, that a moderate dyet is alwaies
good, but not a precise dyet: for a moderate diet is, as Terence
speaketh in Andria: To take nothing too much: which alwaies
is to be observed. But if a man accustome himselfe to
such meats and drinks as at length will breed some inconvenience
in his bodie, or to sleepe or to watch, or any other
thing concerning the order of his life, such custome must
naedes be amended and changed, yet with good discretion,
and not upon the sudden: because sudden changes bring
harme and weaknesse, as Hippocrates teacheth. He therefore
that will alter any custome in dyet rightly, must do it
with three conditions, which are expressed by Hippocrates.
Change is profitable, if it be rightly used, that is, if it be
done in the time of health, and at leisure, and not upon the
sudden.”</p>

<p>This noteworthy book written by Cogan was preceded by
the writings of Louis Cornaro, the Venetian, who forty years
before had published the first edition of his celebrated book,
“The Temperate Life,” and who was a most ardent advocate
of the benefits to be derived by living temperately, especially
in matters of diet. The simple diet which served for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
nourishment of the oldest peoples of Syria, Greece, Egypt,
and of the Romans when they were at the height of their
prosperity and culture, was advocated by Cornaro as conducing
to longevity, better health, and greater comfort of mind
and body. Himself a striking example of the effects of a
reasonable abstinence in diet (the last edition of his book
having been written at the age of ninety-five), his teachings
have continued to attract attention down to the present day;
and although we have no values in grams or calories expressive
of his average food consumption, it is quite evident that
Cornaro lived a very abstemious life, eating little of the heavier
articles of diet common to his time and country. It is perhaps
not strictly physiological to refer to these cases, yet they have
value as representing a sentiment, common to the centuries
now passed, that benefit was to be derived by mankind from
greater care in the taking of food; that prevalent customs
and habits were leading the people into intemperate modes of
life, and that these were surely tending toward the physical
and mental deterioration of the nation. We may attach much
or little weight to these conclusions, but there is a certain
degree of significance in the views, current then as now, that
dietetic customs and habits have no real connection with
bodily requirements.</p>

<p>Passing down to our own times, we find physiologists, by
the aid of scientific methods, studying the effects of smaller
amounts of food (smaller than custom prescribes) on the
condition of the body, thereby evincing a certain degree of
skepticism concerning the dietary standards based on habit
and usage. This has been especially true regarding the
nitrogen requirement, or the need for proteid food. As has
been clearly pointed out in other connections, there are two
distinct needs which the body has for food; one for proteid
or nitrogen, the other for energy-yielding material. According
to the Voit standard, a man of average body-weight doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
a moderate amount of work requires daily 118 grams of proteid
food, or about 16 grams of metabolizable nitrogen, with
fat and carbohydrate sufficient to yield a total fuel value of over
3000 large calories. As we have seen, the fuel value of the
food must of necessity be a variable quantity because of variations
in bodily activity. The more muscular work performed,
the greater must be the intake of carbohydrate and fat, if the
body is to be kept in equilibrium. With proteid or nitrogen,
however, the case is quite different, since with adequate
amounts of non-nitrogenous food, proteid is not drawn upon
for the energy of muscular work. We can conceive of the
nitrogen requirement, therefore, as being a constant factor
in the well-nourished individual and dependent primarily
upon body-weight, or more exactly, upon the weight of true
proteid-containing tissue. Obviously, whatever else happens,
there must be enough proteid food taken daily to maintain
the body in nitrogen equilibrium. If this can be accomplished
only by the ingestion of 16 grams of metabolizable nitrogen,
then it is plain that the daily ration must contain at least 118
grams of proteid food; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, it must conform approximately
at least to ordinary usage.</p>

<p>This question has been studied by many investigators,
with very interesting and suggestive results. Thus, in 1887,
<span class="nowrap">Hirschfeld<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> reported some experiments on himself, twenty-four
years of age and weighing 73 kilos. His ordinary diet
contained daily 100 to 130 grams of proteid, and the amount
of nitrogen excreted varied from 16 to 20 grams per day,
corresponding to a metabolism of proteid equal to the amount
ingested. In other words, the body was essentially in nitrogen
equilibrium. Then, for a period of fifteen days, during
which he was unusually active, he lived on a diet in which
the content of proteid corresponded to only 6 grams of nitrogen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
per day, and yet he remained in nitrogen equilibrium.
The diet made use of was composed essentially of milk, eggs,
rice, potatoes, bread, butter, sugar, and coffee, with some wine
and beer, and on two days a little meat. It is to be observed
that the nitrogen or proteid intake per day was only one-third
of what he was accustomed to consume. In a second experiment,
covering ten days, similar results were obtained. So
that evidence was afforded that a young and vigorous man
can maintain his body in nitrogen equilibrium, for fifteen consecutive
days at least, on an amount of proteid food equal to
only one-third of the minimal requirement called for by common
usage. Plainly, the difference between a daily consumption
of 118 grams of proteid food and 40 grams represents a
large percentage saving, both of proteid and in the metabolism
of proteid matter with all the attendant transformations. In
these experiments, however, the subject consumed relatively
large amounts of non-nitrogenous food, notably butter, of
which on some days he took as much as 100 grams. The
average fuel value of his food ranged from 3750 to 3916 calories
per day; a fact of some importance, since it is to be
remembered that both fat and carbohydrate tend to protect
proteid metabolism.</p>

<p>In an experiment reported in 1889 by Carl <span class="nowrap">Voit<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span>, on a
vegetarian weighing about 57 kilos, it was found that with
a purely vegetable diet the subject was able, for a few days
at least, to maintain his body in essentially a condition of
nitrogen equilibrium on a daily diet containing 8.4 grams
of nitrogen, corresponding to 52.5 grams of proteid. In addition,
there was a large consumption of starchy food with
some fat. Klemperer<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> experimenting with two young men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
having a body-weight of 64 and 65.5 kilos, respectively, was
able to keep them in a condition of nitrogenous equilibrium
for a period of eight days on 4.38 grams and 3.58 grams of
nitrogen per day. The diet, however, had a large fuel value,
5020 calories per day, and contained in addition to the small
amount of proteid, 264 grams of fat, 470 grams of carbohydrate,
and 172 grams of alcohol. Breisacher<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span> in an experiment
on himself, using a mixed diet composed of 67.8 grams
of proteid, 494.2 grams of carbohydrate, and 60.5 grams of fat
per day, with a total fuel value of 2866 calories, observed
a daily excretion of nitrogen during thirty days of 8.23 grams.
This corresponds to a metabolism of 51.4 grams of proteid,
thus showing that the 67 grams of food-proteid taken was
quite sufficient to maintain nitrogen equilibrium for the
above length of time.</p>

<p>Caspari and <span class="nowrap">Glässner<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> have reported observations made on
two vegetarians, a man and his wife, aged 49 and 48 years
respectively, who had lived for some years exclusively on a
vegetable diet. The man had a body-weight of 68.8 kilos,
while the woman weighed 58 kilos. During five days, the
man consumed per day, on an average, 7.83 grams of nitrogen
and 4559 calories. This corresponds to 0.114 gram of nitrogen
per kilo of body-weight, and 66 calories per kilo. On
this diet, the man gained slightly in weight and showed a plus
nitrogen balance of 5.2 grams for the five days. In other
words, even this low nitrogen or proteid intake was more than
sufficient to meet the wants of his body. The wife, during
the same period of time, consumed per day 5.33 grams of
nitrogen and 2715 calories, corresponding to 0.092 gram of
nitrogen per kilo of body-weight and 47 calories per kilo.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
On this diet, the woman gained 0.9 kilo in weight during the
five days, and like the man, she showed a plus nitrogen
balance of 2.45 grams for the entire period. The somewhat
noted experiments of Sivén have been referred to in another
connection, and it will suffice to recall the fact that he was
able, with a body-weight of 60 kilos, to establish nitrogen
equilibrium on 6.26 grams of nitrogen, and for a day or two
on 4.5 grams of nitrogen, with a total fuel value of only
2444 calories in the day’s ration.</p>

<p>These few illustrations will serve to indicate that, so far
as the maintenance of nitrogen equilibrium is concerned during
short periods of time, there is no necessity for the consumption
of proteid food in such amounts as common usage
dictates. The high proteid intake called for by the “standard
dietaries,” and the ordinary practices of mankind, is not
needed to establish a condition of nitrogen equilibrium. It
would seem, however, as if results of this nature, presented
from time to time by various investigators, have been considered
more in the light of scientific curiosities than as data
having an important bearing on physiological processes. So
strong has been the hold upon the medical and physiological
mind of the necessity of high proteid that such figures as the
above have merely excited comment, without weakening in
any measure the prevalent conviction that health, strength,
and the power to work necessitate a high rate of proteid
exchange.</p>

<p>To one willing to accept the data as having possible significance
there arises at once the question, How long can
the body be maintained in nitrogen equilibrium on such relatively
small quantities of proteid food? In other words, can
experiments of this nature, extending over comparatively
short periods of time, be safely accepted as a reliable means
of measuring the proteid requirements of the body for indefinite
periods? Suppose, says the critic, we grant that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
body can maintain itself in nitrogen equilibrium for a week
or two on a very small amount of proteid food, what proof
have we that in the long run the body will be benefited thereby,
or even able to exist in a condition of normal strength and
vigor? In other words, is a low proteid diet, one that seems
sufficient to maintain the body in nitrogen equilibrium, a
wholly safe one to follow? May there not be other elements
to be considered, aside from nitrogen equilibrium, which, if
fully understood, would satisfactorily account for the customs
of mankind, in which perhaps man’s instincts have been followed
for the betterment of the race? It was with a view
to learning more concerning these questions that five years
ago the writer commenced systematic, experimental, work
upon the nutrition of man, with special reference to his nitrogen
requirements. The experiments and observations have
been continued up to the present time, with many suggestive
results, some of which will now be referred to<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span></p>

<p>One group of subjects was composed of professional men,
professors and instructors in the university, whose work was
mainly mental rather than physical, though by no means
excluding the latter. Of this group, two cases will be referred
to with some regard for detail, since in no other way
can so striking a picture be presented of the effects produced.
The first subject weighed 65 kilos in the fall of 1902, and at
that time was nearly 47 years of age. His dietetic habits
were in accord with common practice, and his daily consumption
of proteid food averaged close to 118 grams. With a
clear recognition of the principle that the habits of a lifetime
should not be too suddenly changed, a very gradual reduction
in the total amount of food, and especially of proteid
matter, was made. This finally resulted, with this particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
subject, in the complete abolition of breakfast, with the exception
of a small cup of coffee. A light lunch was taken
at noontime, followed by a more substantial dinner at night.
There was no change to a vegetable diet, but naturally any
attempt to cut off largely the amount of proteid food necessarily
results in a marked diminution in the quantity of
animal food or meats. It is a somewhat singular though
suggestive fact, that a change of this order gradually results
in a stronger liking for simple foods, with their more delicate
flavor, accompanied by a diminished desire for the heavier
animal foods.</p>

<p>As the day’s ration was gradually reduced in amount,
the body-weight began to fall off, until after some months
it became stationary at 57 kilos, at which point it has
remained practically constant for over three years. The
sixteen pounds of weight lost was composed, mainly at
least, of superfluous fat. For a period of nine months, from
October, 1903, to the end of June, 1904, the amount of proteid
material broken down in the body was determined each
day. The average daily metabolism of nitrogen for the entire
period of nearly nine months amounted to 5.69 grams.
For the last two months, it averaged 5.4 grams per day.
Analyses made from time to time since these figures were
obtained show that the subject is still living at the same low
level of nitrogen metabolism. In fact, the data available
afford satisfactory proof that for a period covering over three
years this particular person has subsisted on an amount of
proteid food equal to a metabolism of not more than 5.8
grams of nitrogen per day. It may be asked why the subject
should have continued such a low proteid diet after the nine
months’ period was completed? In reply, it may be said
that the new habit has taken a firm hold, and entirely supplanted
the dietetic desires and cravings of the preceding
years. Further, the improved condition of health, freedom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
from minor ailments that formerly caused inconvenience and
discomfort, and the greater ability to work without fatigue,
have all combined to place the new habit on a firm basis,
from which there is no desire to change.</p>

<p>Consider for a moment what this lowered consumption of
proteid food really amounts to, as compared with ordinary
usage and the so-called dietary standards. The latter call
for at least 118 grams of proteid or albuminous food daily,
of which 105 grams should be absorbable, in order to maintain
the body in a condition of nitrogen equilibrium, and in
a state of physical vigor and general tone. This would
mean a daily metabolism and excretion of at least 16 grams
of nitrogen. Our subject, however, excreted per day, during
nine months, only 5.69 grams of nitrogen, which means a
metabolism of 35.6 grams of proteid; <i>i. e.</i>, about one-third
the amount ordinarily deemed necessary to meet man’s requirement
for proteid food. But was our subject in nitrogen
equilibrium on this small amount of proteid food? We
answer yes, as the following balance period shows:</p>

<p>In this particular period of six days, the body was really
gaining a little nitrogen, <i>i. e.</i>, storing away a small amount
of proteid for future use, although it may be granted that
the amount was too small to have any special significance.
During this period, the average daily intake of nitrogen was
6.4 grams, equal to 40 grams of proteid food. The average
daily output of nitrogen through kidneys and excrement was
6.24 grams. The average daily output of metabolized nitrogen,
through the kidneys, was 5.44 grams, corresponding to
the breaking down of 34 grams of proteid material. Further,
it should be stated that the total calorific value of the daily
food during this period was less than 2000 calories. Let
me add now a final balance period taken at the close of the
nine months’ trial:</p>

<p>In this period of five days, the average daily intake of
nitrogen was 5.86 grams, corresponding to 36.6 grams of
proteid food. The average daily output of metabolized nitrogen
was 4.92 grams, implying the breaking down in the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
of only 30.7 grams of proteid material per day. The fuel
value of the daily food, calculated as closely as possible, was
less than 2000 calories. The body was essentially in nitrogen
equilibrium, the minus balance being too small to have
any special significance.</p>

<p>It will be instructive to consider next the actual character
and amount of the diet made use of on several of these
balance days:</p>

<p>It can be seen that there was nothing especially peculiar
in these dietaries, aside from their simplicity, except that the
quantities were small. Meat was not excluded; there was
no approach to a cereal diet; there were no fads involved,
nothing but simple moderation in the amounts of nitrogen-containing
foods. Further, there was perfect freedom of
choice; full latitude to consider personal likes and dislikes in
the selection of foods; anything that appealed to the appetite
could be eaten, with the simple restriction that the amount
taken must be small. During the balance days, naturally,
every article of food had to be carefully weighed and analyzed,
which fact undoubtedly tended to limit in some degree
the variety of foods chosen, since increase in the number of
articles meant increased labor in analysis. Quite noticeable,
however, was the extreme constancy in the nitrogen-content
of the daily diet, even on those days when the food was not
weighed. In other words, there had been gradually acquired
a new habit of food consumption, and the individual, unconsciously
perhaps, rarely overstepped the limits fixed by the
new level of proteid metabolism. This is a fact that has been
conspicuous in nearly all of our experiments, where freedom
of choice in the taking of food has been followed; and is in
harmony with the view that after a lower level of proteid
metabolism has once been established, and the body has
become accustomed to the new conditions, there is little tendency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
for any marked deviation from the new standards of
food consumption.</p>

<p>With maintenance of body-weight, together with nitrogen
equilibrium through all these months; and with health,
strength, and mental and physical vigor unimpaired, there is
certainly ground for the belief that the real needs of the body
were as fully met by the lowered consumption of proteid food
as by the quantities called for by the customary standards.
Finally, it should be noted that this particular subject was
small in weight, and hence did not need so much proteid as
a man of heavier body-weight would require. In recognizing
this principle, we may for future comparison calculate the
nitrogen requirement of the body, on the basis of the present
results, per kilo of body-weight. With the weight of the
subject placed at 57 kilos, and with an average daily excretion
of nitrogen amounting to practically 5.7 grams, it is
plain that this individual was quite able to maintain a
condition of equilibrium with a metabolism of 0.1 gram of
nitrogen per kilo of body-weight. Translated into terms of
proteid matter, this would mean a utilization by the body
of 0.625 gram of proteid daily per kilo of body-weight. Regarding
the fuel value of the daily food, we need not be
more precise than to emphasize the fact that so far as could
be determined, on the basis of chemical composition, the
heat value of the food rarely exceeded 1900 calories per
day. If we make a liberal allowance, for the sake of precaution,
it would seem quite safe to say that this particular
individual, under the conditions of life and bodily activity
prevailing, did not apparently need of fuel value more than
2000 calories per day, which would correspond to 35 calories
per kilo of body-weight.</p>

<p>Let us turn now to the second subject in this group, a
man of 76 kilos body-weight, 32 years of age, and of strong
physique. His active life in the laboratory called for greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
physical exertion than the former subject, and consequently
there was need for greater consumption of non-nitrogenous
food, with the accompanying increase in fuel value of the
day’s ration. As in the preceding case, there was no prescribing
of food, but a gradual and voluntary diminution of
proteid material. During the last seven months and a half
of the experiment, the average daily excretion of nitrogen
through the kidneys amounted to 6.53 grams, equivalent to
a metabolism of 40.8 grams of proteid matter daily; a little
more than one-third the minimal quantity called for by common
usage. At first, the body-weight of the subject gradually
fell until it reached 70 kilos, at which point it remained
fairly constant during the last five months. That the quantity
of food taken was quite sufficient to maintain the body
in a condition of nitrogen equilibrium is apparent from the
results of a comparison of income and outgo of nitrogen, as
shown in the following table:</p>

<p>The average daily intake of nitrogen was 8.192 grams,
equivalent to 51.2 grams of proteid food. The average
amount of nitrogen excreted through the kidneys each day
was 6.31 grams, corresponding to a metabolism of 39.43
grams of proteid matter. The plus balance of 0.380 gram of
nitrogen per day shows that not only was the amount of proteid
food consumed quite adequate to meet the demands of the
body, but the latter was able to store up 2.3 grams of proteid
per day. Regarding the character of the food taken by this
subject, it should be stated that there was gradually developed
a tendency toward a pure vegetarian diet. During the last
seven months of the experiment, meats were almost entirely
excluded. The diet voluntarily selected thus differed decidedly
from that of the preceding subject in that it was
much more bulky, contained a larger proportion of undigestible
vegetable matter, and was richer in fats and carbohydrates,
with a corresponding increase in fuel value. The
exact character of the daily dietary is indicated by the following
data of food consumption, on four of the days of the
above balance period:</p>

<p>While the critic might justly say that these dietaries lack
variety and would not appeal to a fastidious taste, there is
force in the illustration which they afford of a simple diet
being quite adequate to meet the wants of the body. Further,
it should be emphasized that there is no special virtue
in any of these dietaries, aside from their simplicity and low
content of nitrogen. They represent individual taste and
selection. Any other form of diet would answer as well,
provided there was not too large an intake of proteid, and
provided further the fuel value of the day’s ration was sufficient
to meet the requirements for heat and work. Again,
it might be said that with this latter subject the daily consumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
of proteid food was considerably larger than with
the first subject. This is indeed true, but it must be remembered
that the second subject had a body-weight of 70
kilos during the last seven months, while the first subject
weighed only 57 kilos. Obviously, with this marked difference
in the weight of living tissue there must be a corresponding
difference in the extent of proteid katabolism, and
consequently a difference in the demand for proteid food.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the smaller subject for a period of many
months showed a proteid katabolism equal to 0.1 gram of
nitrogen, per kilo of body-weight, daily. The second and
larger subject, on a totally different diet, for seven months
and a half, metabolized daily, on an average, 6.53 grams of
nitrogen. Taking the weight of the body at 70 kilos, it is
readily seen that the nitrogen metabolized daily per kilo of
body-weight was 0.093 gram, almost identical with the rate
of nitrogen exchange found with the first subject. It is certainly
very suggestive that these two individuals with their
marked difference in body-weight, under different degrees of
physical activity, and living on different forms of diet, with
only the one point in common of voluntary restriction in the
amount of proteid food, until a new habit had been acquired
and a new level of proteid metabolism attained, should have
quite independently reached exactly the same level of nitrogen
exchange per kilo of body-weight. And when it is remembered
that this was attained by the daily consumption
of not more than one-third to one-half the minimal amount
of proteid food called for by the dietetic customs of mankind,
and with maintenance of all the characteristics of good
health through this comparatively long period of time, there
certainly seems to be justification for the opinion that the
consumption of proteid food, as practised by the people of the
present generation, is far in excess of the needs of the body.
Referring for a moment to the calorific value of the food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
used by the second subject, in the last balance period, it is
to be noted that the heat value per day averaged 2448 calories,
as estimated on the basis of the chemical composition
of the food. This would amount to 34 calories per kilo.
Whether this figure is strictly correct is immaterial; it is
certainly sufficiently so to warrant the statement that the
needs of the body were fully met by an intake of food below
the standards set by usage, and that maintenance of nitrogen
equilibrium on a greatly diminished consumption of proteid
food is possible without increasing the intake of non-nitrogenous
matter.</p>

<p>Finally, as affording additional evidence, we may refer to
a third subject in this group, a man of 65 kilos body-weight,
26 years of age, who for a period of six consecutive months
maintained body-weight, nitrogen equilibrium, and a general
condition of good health, with a proteid metabolism equal to
7.81 grams of nitrogen per day. During the last two months
of the experiment, the average excretion of nitrogen per day
amounted to 6.68 grams, corresponding to a metabolism of
0.102 gram of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight. This figure,
it will be noted, is practically identical with the values obtained
with the preceding subjects, calculated to the same
unit of weight. Further, this third subject did not reduce
his nitrogen intake by an exclusion of meat, but made use of
his ordinary diet gradually reduced in amount. His daily
consumption of proteid food averaged 55 grams, or 8.83 grams
of nitrogen, and on this amount of proteid, without increasing
the intake of fats and carbohydrates, he was quite able to do
his work with preservation of physiological equilibrium.</p>

<p>Views so radically different from those commonly accepted
can be made to carry weight, only by the accumulation of supporting
evidence obtained under widely different conditions
of life, and by methods which will defy criticism. It might
be argued, and with perhaps some justification, that while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
professional men, with freedom from muscular work, may be
able to live without detriment on a relatively small amount
of proteid food, such a conclusion would not be warranted
for the great majority of mankind with their necessarily
greater muscular activity. We are confronted at once with
the oft-heard statement that the laboring man requires more
proteid food; he has a more vigorous appetite, and he must
take an abundance of meat and other foods rich in proteid, if
he is to maintain his ability as a worker. Note the statements
already made in other connections regarding the food
consumption of Maine lumbermen, of men on the football
team, of trained athletes in general. These men consume
large amounts of proteid daily, because their work demands
it. If the demand did not really exist, they would
not so agree in the use of high proteid standards, so runs
the argument. The custom certainly does exist and is
almost universally followed; men in training for athletic
events deem it necessary to consume large amounts of proteid
food. Custom and long experience sanction a high
proteid diet, rich in nitrogen, for the development and maintenance
of that strength and vigor that help to make the
accomplished athlete. It is common knowledge to-day, however,
that the energy of muscle work does not have its origin
in the breaking down of proteid material, certainly not when
there is an adequate amount of fat and carbohydrate in the
diet. A high proteid intake must therefore be called for
because of some subtle quality, not at present fully understood.
It must not be subjected to criticism, however, because
it is sanctioned by custom, habit, and common usage.</p>

<p>Still, I have ventured to experiment somewhat with a
group of eight university athletes, all trained men, and with
some surprising results. We have not space for details, but
it may be mentioned that the men were young, from 22 to 27
years of age, and were experts in some field of athletic work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
By a preliminary study of their ordinary dietetic habits, it
was found that they were all large consumers of proteid food,
with a corresponding high rate of proteid katabolism. One
subject of 92 kilos body-weight, during ten days, showed an
average daily excretion through the kidneys of 22.79 grams
of nitrogen, implying a metabolism of 142 grams of proteid
matter per day. On one of these days, the nitrogen excretion
reached the high figure of 31.99 grams, corresponding to a
metabolism of about 200 grams of proteid matter. Calculated
per kilo of body-weight, this means a metabolism of
0.35 gram of nitrogen, or three and a half times the amount
needed by the three professional men for the maintenance
of nitrogen equilibrium. These subjects, with an intelligent
comprehension of the point at issue, and with full freedom
in the choice of food, gradually diminished their daily consumption
of proteid material, at the same time cutting down
very markedly the total consumption of food. The experiment
extended through five months, and during the last two
months, the average daily excretion of metabolized nitrogen of
the eight men amounted to 8.81 grams per man. This corresponds
to a metabolism of 55 grams of proteid matter.</p>

<p>Further, the average daily output of nitrogen through the
kidneys during the preceding two months was in many cases
nearly, if not quite, as low as during the last two months of
the experiment. If we contrast this average daily exchange
of 8.81 grams of nitrogen with the average output prior to
the change in diet, it is easy to see that the men were living
on about one-half the amount of proteid food they were
formerly accustomed to take. Moreover, if the metabolized
nitrogen for each individual, with one exception, is calculated
per kilo of body-weight, it is seen to vary from 0.108
gram to 0.134 gram; somewhat higher than was observed with
the older professional men, but not conspicuously so. Again,
it is to be emphasized that the lowered intake of proteid food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
with these men was quite adequate to maintain their bodies
in nitrogen equilibrium. We may cite a single case by way
of illustration:</p>

<p>The daily intake of nitrogen during this balance period
averaged 8.83 grams, corresponding to 55.1 grams of proteid
food. The metabolized nitrogen eliminated through the kidneys
averaged 7.58 grams per day, thus showing a daily average
metabolism of 47.37 grams of proteid matter. With a
body-weight of 63 kilos, this individual was maintaining
equilibrium on a metabolism of 0.120 gram of nitrogen per
kilo of body-weight. The fuel value of the day’s food as
estimated did not exceed 2800 calories, thus substantiating
the general statement that there is no need for increasing the
fuel value of the food in any attempt to maintain a lower
nitrogen level. This particular individual, in his choice of
food, unconsciously drifted&mdash;as he expressed it&mdash;toward a
simple vegetable diet, without, however, excluding meat entirely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>

<p>Here, again, we have dietaries not particularly attractive to
every one, but they represent the choice of an individual who
was following his own preferences, and like the preceding
dietaries they are characterized by simplicity. In any event,
they were quite adequate for the wants of the body, and
their value to us lies in the proof they afford that a relatively
small intake of proteid food will not only bring about
and maintain nitrogen equilibrium for many months, and
probably indefinitely, but that such a form of diet is equally
as effective with vigorous athletes, accustomed to strenuous
muscular effort, as with professional men of more sedentary
habits. Further, these many months of observation with
different individuals all lead to the opinion that there are
no harmful results of any kind produced by a reduction in
the amount of proteid food to a level commensurate with the
actual needs of the body. Body-weight, health, physical
strength, and muscular tone can all be maintained, in partial
illustration of which may be offered two photographs of one
of the eight athletes taken toward the end of the experiment;
pictures which are certainly the antithesis of enfeebled muscular
structure, or diminished physical vigor.</p>

<p>General acceptance of a new theory, or a new point
of view, can be expected only when there is an adequate
amount of scientific evidence on which the theory can
safely rest. Facts cannot be ignored, and the larger the
amount of supporting evidence the more certain becomes the
general truth of the theory to which it points. Corroborative
evidence, therefore, is always desirable, and he who
would open up a new point of view must be zealous in accumulating
facts to uphold his position. Critics there are
without number who are ever ready to pick flaws in an argument
or overturn a theory, especially if the one or the other
stands opposed to their own point of view. This, however,
is highly advantageous for the advance of sound knowledge,
since it necessarily prompts the advocate to search in all
directions for added data, by which he can build a bulwark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
of fact sufficient to defy just criticism. Further, the true
scientific spirit demands persistent and painstaking effort in
the search after truth, that error and misconception may be
avoided.</p>

<p>In harmony with these ideas, our attempt to ascertain
the real needs of the body for proteid food led us to enlarge
our evidence by a series of experiments with still another
body of men, <i>i. e.</i>, a detail of soldiers from the United States
army<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> This was a somewhat more difficult and ambitious
undertaking, since the number of subjects involved was
larger, and because with this group of men we could not
expect quite that high degree of intelligent co-operation
afforded by the preceding subjects. Still, this very fact was
in a sense an added inducement, since it offered the opportunity
of experimenting with a body of men who naturally
would not take kindly to anything that looked like deprivation,
and whose continued co-operation could be expected
only by satisfying their natural demands for food. If this
could be accomplished by an intelligent prescription in their
daily diet, and the experiment brought to a successful conclusion,
with maintenance of body-weight, nitrogen equilibrium,
health, strength, and general vigor; with an intake
of proteid food essentially equal to that adopted by the preceding
subjects, corroborative evidence of the highest value
would be obtained.</p>

<p>The detail was composed of a detachment of twenty men
from the Hospital Corps of the army, under the command
of a first lieutenant and assistant surgeon. They were located
in a convenient house near to the laboratory, where they lived
during their six months’ stay in New Haven, under military
discipline, and subject to the constant surveillance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
commanding officer and the non-commissioned officers. Having
well-trained cooks and assistants, with all necessary
facilities for preparing and serving their food, with members
of the laboratory staff to superintend the weighing of the
food as it was placed before the men, and with intelligent
clerks to attend to the many details connected with such an
undertaking, a somewhat unique physiological experiment
was started. Thirteen members of the detachment really
took part in the experiment as subjects, and they represented
a great variety of types: of different ages, nationalities,
temperaments, and degrees of intelligence. They were men
accustomed to living an active life under varying conditions,
and they naturally had great liking for the pleasures of eating.
Further, it should be remembered that, although the
men had volunteered for the experiment, they had no personal
interest whatever in the principles involved, and it
could not be expected that they would willingly incommode
themselves, or suffer any great amount of personal inconvenience.
Again, there were necessary restrictions placed
upon their movements, when relieved from duty, which constituted
something of a hardship in the minds of many of the
men and added to the irksomeness and monotony of their
daily life. Regularity of life was insisted upon, and this
was a condition which brought to some of the men a new
experience. These facts are mentioned because their recital
will help to make clear that, from the standpoint of the men,
there were certain depressing influences connected with the
experiment which would add to any personal discomfort
caused by restriction of diet.</p>

<p>The ordinary army ration to which these men were accustomed
was rich in proteid, especially in meat, and during the
first few days they were allowed to follow their usual dietary
habits, in order that data might be obtained bearing on their
average food consumption. The details of one day’s food<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
intake will suffice to show the average character and amount
of the food eaten per man:</p>

<div class="fs80">
<p class="pl3hi3">Breakfast.&mdash;Beefsteak 222 grams, gravy 68 grams, fried potatoes 234 grams,
onions 34 grams, bread 144 grams, coffee 679 grams, sugar 18 grams.</p>

<p class="pl3hi3">Dinner.&mdash;Beef 171 grams, boiled potatoes 350 grams, onions 55 grams, bread
234 grams, coffee 916 grams, sugar 27 grams.</p>

<p class="pl3hi3">Supper.&mdash;Corned beef 195 grams, potatoes 170 grams, onions 21 grams, bread
158 grams, fruit jelly 107 grams, coffee 450 grams, sugar 21 grams.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not necessary to comment upon the large proportion
of proteid matter in the day’s ration; the three large portions
of meat testify clearly enough to that fact, while the
three equally large volumes of coffee indicate a natural disposition
toward generous consumption of anything available.
Habit, reinforced by inclination, had evidently placed these
men on a high plane of food consumption.</p>

<p>For a period of six months, a daily dietary was prescribed
for the subjects; the food for each meal and for every man
being of known composition, each article being carefully
weighed, while the content of nitrogen in the day’s ration
was so graded as to bring about a gradual reduction in the
amount of proteid ingested. The rate of proteid katabolism
was likewise determined each day by careful estimation of
the excreted nitrogen, balance experiments being made from
time to time in order to ascertain if the men were in a condition
of nitrogen equilibrium. Finally, it should be mentioned
that the subjects lived a fairly active life, having
each day a certain amount of prescribed exercise in the
university gymnasium, in addition to the regular drill and
other duties associated with their usual work.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><i>Photograph of the soldiers taken at the close of the experiment</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>As just stated, the amount of proteid food was gradually
reduced, three weeks being taken to bring the amount down
to a level somewhat commensurate with the estimated needs
of the body. This naturally resulted in diminishing largely
the intake of meat, though by no means entirely excluding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
it. Effort was constantly made to introduce as much variety
as was possible with simple foods, though the main problem
with this group of men was to keep the volume of the food
up to such a point as would dispel any notion that they
were not having enough to eat. A second problem, which
at first threatened trouble, was the fear of the men, as they
saw the proportion of meat gradually drop off, that they were
destined to lose their strength; but fortunately, they very
soon began to realize that their fears in this direction were
groundless, and a little later their personal experience opened
their eyes to possible advantages which quickly drove away
all further thought of danger, and made them quite content
to continue the experiment. We may introduce here a few
samples of the daily food given to the men after they had
reached their lower level of proteid intake:</p>

<p>These dietaries are fair samples of the daily food given the
men during the last five months of the experiment. If we
place the intake of nitrogen at 8.5 grams per day, or even 9
grams daily, it would mean at the most an average daily consumption
of 56 grams of proteid; viz., about one-third the
amount they were accustomed to take under their ordinary
modes of life. Of greater interest, however, is the rate of
proteid katabolism shown by these men under the above
conditions of diet, during the five months’ period. The
average daily output of metabolized nitrogen for each man
ranged from 7.03 grams&mdash;the lowest&mdash;to 8.91 grams&mdash;the
highest. An excretion of 7.03 grams of nitrogen per day
means a katabolism, or breaking down, of 43.9 grams of proteid
matter; while the excretion of 8.91 grams of nitrogen
corresponds to a katabolism of 55.6 grams of proteid. The
grand average, <i>i. e.</i>, the average daily output of nitrogen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
of all the men for the five months’ period amounted to 7.8
grams per man, corresponding to an average daily katabolism
of 48.75 grams of proteid. The heaviest man of the group
had a body-weight of 74 kilograms, while his average daily
output of metabolized nitrogen amounted to 7.84 grams.
This corresponds to 0.106 gram of metabolized nitrogen per
kilo of body-weight; a figure which agrees quite closely with
the lowest figures obtained with the preceding subjects when
calculated to the same unit of weight. Many of the men,
however, metabolized considerably more nitrogen or proteid
in proportion to their body-weight, due in a measure at least
to the fact that they were being fed more liberally with proteid
food than was really necessary for the needs of the body.
In this group, we have a body of men doing a reasonable
amount of physical work, who lived without discomfort for
five consecutive months on a daily consumption of proteid
food not much, if any, greater than one-third the amount
called for by common usage, and the average fuel value of
which certainly did not exceed 3000 calories per day. Indeed,
so far as could be determined on the basis of chemical
composition, the heat value of the food was quite a little
less than this figure would imply.</p>

<p>If the relatively small amount of proteid food made use of
in this trial was inadequate for the real necessities of the
body, some indication of it would be expected to reveal itself,
with at least some of the men, by the end of the period. One
criticism frequently made is that the subject draws in some
measure upon his store of body material. Should this be the
case, it is evident that body-weight&mdash;in such a long experiment
as this&mdash;will gradually but surely diminish. Further,
the subject will show a minus nitrogen balance, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, there will
be a constant tendency for the body to give off more nitrogen
than it takes in. As bearing on the first point, the following
table showing the body-weights of the men at the commencement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
of the experiment in October, and at the close of the
experiment in April will be of interest:</p>

<p>As is readily seen, five of the men practically retained their
weight or made a slight gain. Of the others, Coffman, Loewenthal,
Sliney, and Cohn lost somewhat, but the amount was
very small. Further, the loss occurred during the first few
weeks of the experiment, after which their weight remained
practically stationary. Fritz and Oakman lost weight somewhat
more noticeably, but this loss likewise occurred during
the earlier part of the trial. The accompanying photographs
of Fritz, taken at the close of the experiment, show plainly that
such loss of weight as he suffered did not detract from the
appearance of his well-developed musculature. Certainly, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
photographs do not show any signs of nitrogen starvation, or
suggest the lack of any kind of food.</p>

<p>Of all the men, Bates was the only one who underwent
any great loss of weight. He, however, was quite stout, and
the work in the gymnasium, reinforced by the change in diet,
brought about what was for him a very desirable loss of body-weight.
It is evident, therefore, that there was no marked
or prolonged loss of body-weight as a result of the continued
use of the low proteid diet. Regarding the second
point, viz., nitrogen equilibrium, the following illustrations
will suffice to indicate the relationship existing between the
income and outgo of nitrogen. A balance experiment with
each of the men, lasting seven days, February 29 to March 6,
is here shown, the figures given being the daily averages for
the period:</p>

<p>With one exception, all of the men were plainly having
more proteid food than was necessary to maintain the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
in nitrogen equilibrium, the plus nitrogen balance in most
cases being fairly large. It is only necessary to remember
that a gain to the body of 1 gram of nitrogen means a laying
by of 6.25 grams of proteid, and with such a gain per day it
is apparent that the men were really being supplied with an
excess of proteid food. This view is supported by the fact
that a later balance experiment, when considerably less proteid
food was being given, still showed many of the men in a
condition of plus balance, or with a minus balance so small as
to indicate essentially nitrogen equilibrium. The following
figures, being daily averages of a balance period about the

<p>A daily intake of 8.5 grams of nitrogen means the consumption
of 53 grams of proteid. Under these conditions of
diet, the average daily amount of nitrogen metabolized was
6.45 grams, corresponding to 40.3 grams of proteid. The men
were practically in a condition of nitrogen equilibrium, so
that we are apparently justified in the general statement that
the simple dietary followed with these men during the six
months’ experiment, and which was accompanied by an average
daily metabolism, after the first three weeks, of 7.8 grams
of nitrogen, was certainly sufficient to maintain both body-weight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
and nitrogen equilibrium. Lastly, emphasis may be
laid upon the fact that these values for nitrogen do not
necessarily represent the minimal proteid requirement of the
human body, since it is a well-established physiological principle
that by increase of non-nitrogenous food the rate of
proteid katabolism can always be further diminished; a principle
which is plainly in harmony with the view that a high
rate of proteid exchange is not a necessary requisite for the
welfare of the body.</p>

<p>The experimental results presented afford very convincing
proof that so far as body-weight and nitrogen equilibrium are
concerned, the needs of the body are fully met by a consumption
of proteid food far below the fixed dietary standards,
and still further below the amounts called for by the recorded
habits of mankind. General health is equally well
maintained, and with suggestions of improvement that are
frequently so marked as to challenge attention. Most conspicuous,
however, though something that was entirely unlooked
for, was the effect observed on the muscular strength
of the various subjects. When the experiments were planned,
it was deemed important to arrange for careful quantitative
tests of the more conspicuous muscles of the body, with a
view to measuring any loss of strength that might occur from
the proposed reduction in proteid food. The thought that
prompted this action was a result of the latent feeling that
somehow muscular strength must be dependent more or less
upon the proteid constituents of the muscles, and that consequently
the cutting down of proteid food would inevitably
be felt in some degree. The most that could be hoped for
was that muscle tone and muscular strength might be maintained
unimpaired. Hence, we were at first quite astonished
at what was actually observed.</p>

<p>With the soldier detail, fifteen distinct strength tests were
made with each man during the six months’ period, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
means of appropriate dynamometer tests applied to the muscles
of the back, legs, chest, upper arms, and forearms,
reinforced by quarter-mile run, vault, and ladder tests, etc.
The so-called “total strength” of the man was computed
by multiplying the weight of the body by the number of
times the subject was able to push up (strength of triceps
muscles) and pull up (strength of biceps muscles) his body
while upon the parallel bars, to this product being added
the strength (dynamometer tests) of hands, legs, back, and
chest. It should be added that all of these tests were
made quite independently in the university gymnasium by
the medical assistants and others in charge of the work there.
It will suffice for our purpose to give here the strength tests
of the various members of the soldier detail at the beginning
and close of the experiment.</p>

<p>Without exception, we note with all of the men a phenomenal
gain in strength, which demands explanation. Was it
all due to the change in diet? Probably not, for these men
at the beginning of the experiment were untrained, and it is
not to be assumed that months of practical work in the gymnasium
would not result in a certain amount of physical development,
with corresponding gain in muscular skill and
power. Putting this question aside for the moment, however,
it is surely proper to emphasize this fact; viz., that although
the men for a period of five months were restricted to a daily
diet containing only one-third to one-half the amount of
proteid food they had been accustomed to, there was no loss
of physical strength; no indication of any physical deterioration
that could be detected. In other words, the men were
certainly not being weakened by the lowered intake of proteid
food. This is in harmony with the principle, already discussed,
that the energy of muscle work comes primarily
from the breaking down of non-nitrogenous material, and consequently
a diminished intake of proteid food can have no
inhibitory effect, provided, of course, there is an adequate
amount of proteid ingested to satisfy the endogenous requirements
of the tissues.</p>

<p>On the other hand, recalling the large number of nitrogenous
cleavage products which result from the breaking down
of proteid material, we can conceive of an exaggerated exogenous
proteid katabolism which may flood the tissues and
the surrounding lymph with a variety of nitrogenous waste
products, having an inhibitory effect upon the muscle fibres
themselves, or upon the peripheral endings of the motor nerves,
by which the muscles are prevented, directly or indirectly, from
working at their highest degree of efficiency. This being true,
a reduction of the exogenous katabolism to a level more nearly
commensurate with the real needs of the body might result in
a marked increase in the functional power of the tissue. However<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
this may be, the fact remains that all of the subjects
showed this great gain in strength; and furthermore, there
was a noticeable gain in self-reliance and courage in their
athletic work, both of which are likewise indicative of an improved
condition of the body. How far these improvements
are attributable to training and to the more regular life the
men were leading, and how far to the change in diet, cannot
be definitely determined. We may venture the opinion, however,
for reasons to be made clear shortly, that the change in
diet was in a measure at least responsible for the increased
efficiency. As the writer has already expressed it, there must
be enough food to make good the daily waste of tissue, enough
food to furnish the energy of muscular contraction, but any
surplus over and above what is necessary to supply these needs
is not only a waste, but may prove an incubus, retarding the
smooth working of the machinery and detracting from the
power of the organism to do its best work.</p>

<p>Let us now turn our attention for a moment to the group
of university athletes, remembering that these men had been
in training for many months, and some of them for several
years, prior to the commencement of the trial with a reduced
proteid intake. In the words of the director of the gymnasium,
“These eight men were in constant practice and in the
pink of condition; they were in ‘training form’ when they
began the changed diet.” Some of them had gained marked
distinction for their athletic work; one during the early
months of the test won the Collegiate and All-around Inter-collegiate
Championship of America. Compare now the
strength tests of these men as taken at the beginning and
end of the five months’ experiment, during which they reduced
their daily intake of proteid food more than fifty per cent:</p>

<p>It is to be observed that the majority of these trained men
showed at the first trial in January a total strength test approximately
equal to that of the soldier detail at the close of
their experiment. This by no means implies that the latter
men owed their gain in strength wholly to the systematic
training they had undergone, but it is certainly plausible to
assume that in a measure this was the case. In any event, it
is plain that the long-continued low proteid diet of the soldiers
had not interfered with a progressive muscular development,
and the attainment of a high degree of muscular
strength.</p>

<p>The noticeable feature in the figures obtained with the athletes,
however, is the striking difference between the January
and June results. Every man, without exception, showed a
decided gain in his muscular power as measured by the strength
tests. This improvement, to be sure, was not so marked as
with the soldiers; a fact to be expected, since with these men
the element of training and the acquisition of proficiency in
athletic work could have played no part in the observed gain.
Further, most of the tests indicated that the gain was progressive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
each month showing an improvement, in harmony with
the growing effect of the diminished proteid intake. With
these subjects, the only tangible change in their mode of life
which could in any sense be considered as responsible for their
gain in strength was the change in diet. Consequently, it
seems perfectly justifiable to conclude that the observations
presented afford reasonable proof of the beneficial effects of a
lowered proteid intake upon the muscular strength of man.</p>

<p>The significance of such a conclusion is manifestly obvious.
It confirms and gives added force to the observations that
man can profitably maintain nitrogen equilibrium, and body-weight,
upon a much smaller amount of proteid food than he
is accustomed to consume. It harmonizes with the view that
the normal requirements of the body for food, under which
health, strength, and maximum efficiency are best maintained,
are on a far lower level than the ordinary practices of mankind
would lead one to believe. The widespread opinion that
a rich proteid diet, with the correspondingly high rate of
proteid metabolism, is a necessity for the preservation of
bodily strength and vigor, is seen to be without foundation;
for even the most conservative estimate of the real value of
these strength tests must carry with it the conviction that
lowering the consumption of proteid food does not at least
result in any weakening of the body. This is a fact of vital
importance, for it needs no argument to convince even the
most optimistic that while it might be possible to maintain
body-weight and nitrogen equilibrium on a small amount of
proteid food, such a form of physiological economy would not
only be of no advantage to the individual, but would be
positively injurious if there was a gradual weakening of the
muscles of the body with decrease of physical strength, vigor,
and endurance.</p>

<p>Another fact to be emphasized in this connection was the
conviction, gradually acquired by many of the subjects, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
they suffered less from fatigue after vigorous muscular effort
than formerly. This was especially conspicuous in the case
of Donahue, whose work on the Varsity basket-ball team
called for vigorous exercise. It is interesting to note that
this athlete, of 63 kilos body-weight, for the last four months
of the experiment showed an average daily katabolism of 7.45
grams of nitrogen, corresponding to a breaking down of 46.5
grams of proteid material daily. Yet, with this low rate of
proteid exchange, he maintained his position on the team with
satisfaction to all, and with the consciousness of improved
physical condition and greater freedom from fatigue. Other
subjects, as the laboratory workers of the professional group,
observed that the customary late afternoon fatigue, coincident
with the continued walking and standing about the laboratory,
gradually became far less conspicuous than usual; so that
there seemed to be a consensus of opinion that in some way
the change in diet was conducive to greater freedom from
muscular weariness.</p>

<p>It is well understood by physiologists that the ability of
a muscle to do work is inhibited by any condition that tends
to depress the general nutritive state of the body, or that
interferes with the local nutrition of the muscle or muscles
involved. On the other hand, there are certain well-recognized
conditions that tend to augment the power of the muscle,
notably an increased circulation of blood through the tissue,
the taking of food, and especially the introduction of sugar.
Further, experiments have shown that when a given set of
muscles has been made to work excessively, other muscles of
the body quite remote will share in the fatigue, thus implying
that muscular weariness and the diminished power to do work
are connected with what may be termed fatigue products,
which are distributed by means of the circulation. In this
way, muscles and nerve endings alike are exposed to the
inhibitory influence of waste products of unknown composition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
formed in the muscle, and as previously stated, we may
conceive of an exaggerated exogenous katabolism, with excessive
proteid intake, by which muscular fatigue and weariness
may be augmented; hence, the beneficial effect in this direction
of a more rational food consumption, by which proteid katabolism
shall be reduced to a true physiological level.</p>

<p>With these marked effects on strength and fatigue, it is
reasonable to assume that some corresponding action may be
exerted on physical endurance. As is well known, strength
and endurance, though related, are quite distinct and can be
separately measured. Strength tests, however, as usually
carried out in gymnasium work, do involve in considerable
degree the question of endurance, since it is customary to use
as one of the factors in estimating total strength the number
of times the man can pull up, or push up, his body on the
parallel bars. Strictly speaking, however, the strength of
a muscle is measured by the maximum force it can exert in a
single contraction, while its endurance is estimated from the
number of times it can contract well within the limit of its
strength.</p>

<p>It is well known that endurance, both physical and
mental, is one of the most variable of the human faculties,
and it is usually considered that exercise or training is the
chief cause of the differences so frequently seen. The Maine
guide will row a boat or paddle a canoe for the entire day
without undue fatigue, while the novice, though he may have
the necessary strength, lacks the endurance to continue the
task longer than a few hours. As expressed by Professor
Fisher, “Some persons are tired by climbing a flight of stairs,
whereas the Swiss guides, throughout the summer season, day
after day spend the entire time in climbing the Matterhorn
and other peaks; some persons are ‘winded’ by running a
block for a street car, whereas a Chinese coolie will run for
hours on end; in mental work, some persons are unable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
apply themselves more than an hour at a time, whereas
others, like Humboldt, can work almost continuously through
eighteen hours of the day.” Again, Fisher states that
“among some 75 tests of different persons holding their arms
horizontal, many were found whose arms actually dropped
against their will inside of 10 minutes, whereas several were
able to hold them up over 1 hour, and one man held them 3
hours and 20 minutes, or a round 200 minutes, and then
dropped them voluntarily. Similarly with deep knee-bending,
some persons were found physically unable to rise again from
the stooping posture after accomplishing less than 500 bendings,
whereas several succeeded in stooping 1000 times, and in
one case, 2400.” Here, we have inherent differences in endurance
not associated with training or exercise, and the question
may well be asked, What is the cause of these radical variations
in the ability to repeat a simple muscular exertion?</p>

<p>Hitherto, little attention has been paid to the possible influence
of diet upon this faculty. It has always been assumed
that endurance, like physical strength, is augmented by a rich
proteid diet, but it has never been considered that diet by itself
was a factor of any great moment as compared with training or
persistent exercise. It is true that claims have been advanced
from time to time concerning the beneficial effects on endurance
of a vegetable diet, and vegetarians have frequently presented
glowing reports of the great increase in endurance they
have experienced, but little attention has been given to such
statements, and the matter has remained more or less in
obscurity.</p>

<p>Recently, Professor Irving Fisher<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> of Yale, has conducted
an interesting experiment on the influence of a change in
diet on endurance, having the co-operation of nine healthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
students as subjects. The experiment extended through five
months, with endurance tests at the beginning, middle, and end
of the period. At the outset, the men consumed daily an
average of 2830 calories, of which 210 were in the form of
flesh foods, such as meats, poultry, fish and shell-fish; 2.6
calories of proteid being ingested for each pound of body-weight.
At the close of the experiment, the per capita calories
had fallen to 2220, of which only 30 were in flesh
foods, and the proteid had fallen to 1.4 calories per pound of
body-weight. In other words, the total calories of the daily
ration had dropped off about 25 per cent, the proteid about 40
per cent, and the flesh foods over 80 per cent, or to about one-sixth
of their original amount.</p>

<p>To determine the endurance of the subjects, six simple
gymnastic tests were employed, and one of mental endurance.
The physical tests consisted of (1) in rising on the toes as
often as possible; (2) deep knee-bending, or stooping as far
as possible and rising to the standing posture, repeating
as often as possible; (3) while lying on the back, raising
the legs from the floor to a vertical position and lowering
them again, repeating to the point of physical exhaustion;
(4) raising a 5-lb. dumb-bell (with the triceps) in each
hand from the shoulder up to the highest point above the
head, repeating to the point of physical exhaustion; (5)
holding the arms from the sides horizontally for as long a
time as possible; (6) raising a dumb-bell (with the biceps)
in one hand from a position in which the arm hangs free,
to the shoulder and back, repeating to the point of physical
exhaustion. This test was taken with four successive dumb-bells
of decreasing weight, viz., 50, 25, 10, and 5 pounds
respectively. The mental test consisted in adding specified
columns of figures as rapidly as possible, the object being to
find out whether the rapidity of performing such work tended
to improve during the experiment.</p>

<p>The data presented show a marked improvement in March
and June over the record made at the beginning of the experiment
in January, except in the case of one subject, E. As
Fisher states, the increased endurance observed can be ascribed
only to dietetic causes, since no other factors of known
significance could have aided in the result. The dietetic
changes, as we have seen, consisted in a slight reduction of
the total amount of food consumed daily, but with a large
reduction of the proteid element, especially from flesh foods.
It is significant, says Fisher, that the only man whose
strength and endurance showed any decrease was E, “whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
case was exceptional in almost all respects. His reduction
in quantity of food, except for a spurt at the end, was
less than of most of the men; his reduction in proteid, with
the same exception, was the least of all; his reduction in
quantity of flesh foods was the least of all.” He stands out
conspicuously as the one man whose endurance failed to
improve. The mental test carried out with the subjects
pointed to “a slight increase in mental quickness,” but the
adding test was too short to be of great value.</p>

<p>We see in these results another confirmation of the view
that the welfare of the body is not impaired by a marked
reduction in the amount of proteid food; on the contrary,
benefit results in the increased efficiency which manifests
itself in various directions. Physical endurance is an asset
not to be ignored, and like the strength of an individual, it
may well be fostered by the recognition and practice of
a principle which seemingly has a firm physiological basis.
Whether the fatigue poisons come from the excessive exogenous
katabolism of proteids in general, or whether they are
derived directly in a measure from flesh foods, need not be
considered here; the main point is that by lowering the rate
of proteid katabolism, which necessarily compels a reduction
in the amount of flesh foods, there is a diminished quantity
of nitrogenous waste floating about in the body. Further, we
need not criticise too closely the method by which the reduction
of food is accomplished; whether it be by encouraging
mastication, with a view to better tasting and fuller enjoyment
of the food, to the point of involuntary swallowing; or
whether we follow natural taste and appetite, reinforced by
the use of reason, with a full appreciation of the principle
that the welfare of the body is best subserved by a quantity
of food commensurate with true physiological needs.</p>

<p>In making this presentation of the true food requirements
of the body as based on the results of physiological experimentation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
and observation, I am by no means unmindful of
the dangers of underfeeding; but this is a condition comparatively
rare. When occurring, as stated by Dr. Curtis, “it is
either because of dyspepsia, in which case it really is involuntary,
or comes from some silly notion born of a combination
of innate mental crookedness and that ‘little knowledge’ that
is a dangerous thing.” Overfeeding is the predominant
dietetic sin, and with the prevailing dietary standards, as
fixed by common usage, there is good ground for believing
that it will continue for many years to come. Reason tells
us, however, in the practice of our personal nutrition, to steer
a middle course between physiological excess on the one side,
and the minimal food requirement on the other. To quote
again from Dr. Curtis<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> who has expressed the matter very
forcibly, “The physiological chemist can easily draw a line
on the Scylla (starvation) side of the channel. A dietary
whereby the system gets less than it pays out is, obviously, a
dangerous veer toward starvation rock. But on the Charybdis
(stuffing) side, just as the whirlpool itself has no well-defined
border, the channel boundary is not so easily marked. The
case is exactly analogous to the stoking of a furnace. The
proportion of ash to live coals is a telltale as to <i>under</i>feeding,
but not as to <i>over</i>feeding. With undersupply of fuel the
ashes overbalance the live coals, and the fire is thus foretold
to be going out. But with an oversupply the fire simply
burns the faster: all the fuel continues to be consumed; the
more coal simply makes the more ash, so that equilibrium is
not disturbed, although maintained at a higher level. To
argue, therefore, that a given dietary is none too large, because
the balance between the material receipts and expenditures of
the economy is not upset, would be like saying that a given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
furnace-fire is certainly none too hot, since the ashes raked
out of the fire-box just correspond to the amount of coal
shovelled in. The same would be equally true of a slower
fire consuming much less fuel. The philosophy of the matter
is, then, to find the minimum of steam that will run the
engine, and then maintain a fire somewhat hotter than the
exact requirement, in order to run no risk of failure; or,
to return to the metaphor already employed, the would-be
careful liver must simply note how close to Scylla other
voyagers have sailed with safety, and then steer his own bark
accordingly.”</p>

<p>As one looks through the many careful dietary studies that
have been made in recent years, it is easy to find striking
illustrations of people, and communities of people, who have
lived for long periods of time on dietaries so strikingly simple
and meagre that it seems difficult at first glance to believe
their daily needs could have been entirely satisfied. Yet, such
observations are quite in accord with the facts we have been
presenting, and they afford additional evidence that the artificial
dietary standards that have been set up are widely at
variance with the real requirements of the body for food. It
may be quite true that many of the people referred to have
been and are faddists, with peculiar notions regarding food,
based on religious or other scruples, but that has no bearing
on the main contention that they have lived for many years
on amounts of food ridiculously small as compared with the
ordinary customs of mankind. Thus, in Professor Jaffa’s
<span class="nowrap">report<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> of investigations made among fruitarians and Chinese
of California is an interesting account of a dietary study of a
family of fruitarians, consisting of two women and three
children. They had all been fruitarians from five to seven
years, their diet being limited to nuts and fruit, except for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
the addition of celery, honey, olive oil, and occasionally a
small amount of prepared cereal food. This family was in
the habit of taking only two meals a day; at 10.30 in the
morning and at 5 o’clock in the afternoon. The first meal
always consisted of nuts and fruit, the nuts being eaten first.
At the second meal, nuts were usually replaced by olive oil
and honey. The nuts made use of were almonds, Brazil
nuts, pine nuts, pignolias (a variety of pine nuts), and walnuts.
Fruits, both fresh and dried, were used, the former
including apples, apricots, bananas, figs, grapes, olives (pickled),
oranges, peaches, pears, plums, and tomatoes. The dried fruits
were dates and raisins.</p>

<p>On this limited dietary of raw, uncooked food, with a complete
absence of the high-proteid animal foods, and the ordinary
vegetables, legumes, etc., and without eggs or milk, this
family, with three growing children, had lived all these years.
Note now what Jaffa observed regarding their food consumption.
The first subject, a woman 33 years of age and weighing
90 pounds, was studied for twenty consecutive days, all
the food eaten being carefully weighed and its chemical composition
determined. As a result, it was found that the average
amount of food consumed per day was: proteid, 33
grams; fat, 59 grams; carbohydrate, 150 grams; with a total
fuel value of 1300 calories. The other members of the family
were studied in a similar manner, one of the children being
the subject on two separate occasions. The table (on page
217), showing the average daily food consumption, gives a
summary of the results obtained.</p>

<p>As Professor Jaffa states, the tentative dietary standard for
a woman at light work calls for 90 grams of proteid daily,
with a fuel value of 2500 calories. Both of these women
were light in weight, and furthermore had no occasion to do
much physical work; but even so, a daily consumption of only
0.8 gram and 0.52 gram of proteid, respectively, per kilo of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
body-weight, with the small calorific values indicated, represents
a phenomenally small amount of food. And yet Jaffa, in
referring to the woman with the lowest intake of food, states
that even this small quantity of food, judging from the appearance
and manner of the subject, “seemed sufficient for
her needs, enabling her to do her customary housework and
take care of her two nieces and nephew.” Regarding the
children, it is stated that the commonly accepted American
dietary standard for a child 13 years old and of an average
activity calls for about 90 grams of proteid and 2450 calories.
As is seen from the table, however, the 13-year-old girl
consumed of proteid less than one-third, and of fuel value
only about 60 per cent of the amount called for; yet, says
Jaffa, “notwithstanding the facts brought out by this comparison,
the subject had all the appearances of a well-fed
child in excellent health and spirits.”</p>

<p>We need not consume time in discussing the details of this
experimental study, though the facts are interesting and suggestive,
for it is only the general question of proteid requirement
and calorific value that has interest for us at present.
The fact is perfectly clear that this family of fruitarians,
young and old, were quite able to live and thrive on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
diet, the value of which in proteid and calories was at as
low a level as was attained in our experimental studies.
The rock of starvation, however, was not touched or even
sighted by the voyagers down this stream of nutrition.
We may all agree that it would be preferable, as a rule,
to acquire the proteids, fats, and carbohydrates of our diet
from a greater variety of sources than did the fruitarians; we
might well complain at a dietary so limited in quality; but
the point to be emphasized is that the low intake of proteid
and the low fuel value were quite adequate for meeting the
needs of the body. “It is a difficult matter,” says Professor
Jaffa, “to draw any general conclusions from the foregoing
dietaries without being unjust to the subjects. It would appear,
upon examining the recorded data and comparing the results
with commonly accepted standards, that all the subjects
were decidedly undernourished, even making allowances for
their light weight. But when we consider that the two adults
have lived upon this diet for seven years, and think they are
in better health and capable of more work than they ever
were before, we hesitate to pronounce judgment. The three
children, though below the average in height and weight, had
the appearance of health and strength. They ran and jumped
and played all day like ordinary healthy children, and were
said to be unusually free from colds and other complaints
common to childhood.”</p>

<p>Turning now to a larger community,&mdash;the island nation of
Japan,&mdash;whose exploits in war have recently attracted the
attention of the civilized world, we find a people the great
majority of whom have remained untouched by the prodigality
of western civilization, and whose customs and habits still bear
the imprint of simplicity and frugality. After the restoration
of Japan and the reorganization of the government in 1867,
much attention was directed to the methods of living and to
the dietary habits of the people, with the result that during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
the last twenty-five years there have been slowly accumulating
many important data bearing on the food consumption
of the people. These have recently been brought together in
an interesting volume by Kintaro Oshima, and <span class="nowrap">published<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> in
the English language.</p>

</div>

<p>As is well known, the great majority of the people of Japan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
live mainly on a vegetable diet. It is also known to physiologists
at least that Japanese dietaries are characterized by
a relatively small amount of proteid, though since the passage
of the Food Supply Act of the navy in 1884, the proteid-content
of the navy ration has been decidedly increased. It
will be interesting to note a few of the results collated by
Oshima, and some of the conclusions that he draws from the
data presented. The foregoing table shows a few of the more
striking results of the dietary studies obtained with various
classes of people, where the food used was largely vegetable,
but generally with some admixture of fish or meat.</p>

<p>The figures presented, which represent the actual amounts of
food consumed, with proper correction for the indigestible portion,
show a much smaller intake of proteid than is common
with European and American people; indeed, both proteid and
fuel value are very much less than common practices call for
among western peoples, even when due allowance is made for
differences in body-weight. To quote from Oshima, “Probably
the most interesting of the dietary studies are those with
poorer classes, which comprise by far the larger part of the
population. The dietaries of the miscellaneous class, including
employees, prisoners, etc., consisted largely of vegetable
foods and supplied on an average 59 grams of proteid and
2190 calories of energy per man per day.” Especially suggestive
were the results of a study made with a military
colonist, a type of man very common in Japan; in reality
farmers who live at home, but have military drill at certain
fixed times. The subject was carefully selected under advice
of officers in charge of the district, and weighed 59.9 kilograms.
His diet consisted solely of cereals and vegetables,
being identical with that of the people in the rural districts of
Japan. His daily food was found to be composed of 46.3 grams
of digestible proteid, with a fuel value of 2703 calories.</p>

<p>Even more striking were the results obtained in a study of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
the dietary habits of three healthy natives of Formosa, employed
as day laborers at the military hospital. They weighed
respectively 60.9, 55, and 54.8 kilograms. The main portion
of their diet was rice, supplemented, however, by a little salt
fish, salted melon, spinach, ginger, and greens. The daily
amount of proteid ingested was 48.0 grams (37.4 grams of
digestible proteid), with a total fuel value of 1948 calories.
A composite sample of urine covering seven days showed an
average daily output of metabolized nitrogen of 6.93 grams,
corresponding to a breaking down of 43.3 grams of proteid.</p>

<p>Especially interesting also is a series of experiments with
professional men, reported by Oshima, in which attention was
paid to nitrogen balance. The following table shows the
essential results:</p>

<p>It is to be observed that in all of the above experiments,
excepting two, the subjects gained nitrogen even with the low
proteid intake and the small fuel value of the day’s food.
Particularly noteworthy, in harmony with previous statements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
are the results of the sixth and seventh experiments.
In the sixth experiment, the subject was not able to maintain
nitrogen equilibrium on a diet containing 36.8 grams of digestible
proteid and having a fuel value of 1825 calories, but by
raising the intake of carbohydrate food (seventh experiment) to
462 grams daily, thereby increasing the fuel value of the daily
ration to 2200 calories (with a slight increase in the proteid
incidental thereto), the body was able to change its previous
loss of nitrogen into a gain; in other words, the added carbohydrate
served as a protector of proteid.</p>

<p>The series of experiments as a whole, however, is to be considered
in the light of additional data bearing on the dietary
customs of a people who for generations have apparently lived
and thrived on a daily ration noticeably low in its content of
proteid, as well as low in its calorific value. As Oshima
states, “It is probably fair to infer that the amount of proteid
in the dietaries of the classes living largely on vegetable
foods (and they constitute the larger part of the population)
may not be very far from 60 grams per day,” or 45 grams of
digestible proteid. It is reasonable to assume that the people
live in this way from force of habit or of necessity, and we
may agree with Baelz, a professor connected with the medical
faculty of Tokyo University, “that their diet is sufficient
from a physiological standpoint.” Doubtless a mixed diet,
with a larger proportion of animal food, did their means
readily permit, would offer some advantages from the standpoint
of palatability and variety, but it is questionable if any
material gain in health or strength would result. “It is
sometimes remarked,” says Oshima, “that the peasants in
the rural districts of Japan, living largely on vegetable food,
are really healthier and stronger than people of the better
classes, who live on a mixed diet, and the better physical
condition of the former is commonly believed to be due to
their diet.” This, however, is a difficult matter to decide,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
since there are so many other factors that are liable to play a
part, such as the general conditions of life which are so widely
different in the two classes.</p>

<p>It is plainly evident that the daily diet of the great bulk
of the Japanese people has been characterized by a very low
proteid standard, as contrasted with the standards and usages
of the majority of European and American people. The fact
is brought forward merely as confirmatory evidence, on a
large scale, of the perfect safety of lowering the consumption
of proteid food to somewhere near the level of the physiological
requirements of the body. Generations of low proteid
feeding, with the temperance and simplicity in dietary matters
thereby implied, have certainly not stood in the way of phenomenal
development and advancement when the gateway
was opened for the ingress of modern ideas from western
civilization. Many changes are sure to follow in the footsteps
of the nation’s progress, and among these it is safe to
prophesy that as public and private wealth, and resources in
general, increase, the dietary of the people will gradually
assume a more varied character with corresponding increase
in volume. Whether such a change will prove of real benefit
to the race, time alone can determine.</p>

<p>Having said so much concerning the Japanese, it is proper
that a few additional statements should be made. The
stature and general physique of the people could be advantageously
improved. Is this a question of dietary, or is it
connected with some condition of life on which the daily food
has no bearing; or is it, perchance, a racial characteristic so
deeply ingrained that conditions of environment are without
noticeable influence? These questions cannot be definitely
answered at present. Finally, we may call attention to the
dietary changes inaugurated in recent years in connection
with the new organization of the imperial army and navy.
With a view to increasing the efficiency of the men, following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
the customs of other countries, an act was passed increasing
the amount of proteid food in the navy dietary. Oshima’s
report of the various steps taken to accomplish this end, with
the results that followed, is interesting in several ways.</p>

<p>“A large part of the rice was to be replaced by bread, and
meats were to be used liberally. The experience, during the
first year that this ration was tried, indicated that bread and
meat could not be advantageously substituted immediately for
the rice, because most of the marines were unaccustomed to
these food materials; consequently, a modification of the ration
was introduced in 1885, whereby a rice-barley mixture was
adopted in place of the bread. Barley was considered at that
time as a better article of food than rice, on account of its
higher proteid content, but later investigations showed that
the digestibility of the nutrients of barley was small. In 1886,
an effort was again made to substitute bread for the rice-barley
mixture. In 1890, the ration allowance was reduced by one-fifth
and an amount of money equivalent to the cost of the
reduction in diet was given to each marine with which to buy
accessory food according to his own choice. In 1898, the reduction
was made one-tenth, instead of one-fifth as in previous
years. In 1900, the cash allowance was abolished and a
new ration adopted.” This ration contains about 150 grams
of proteid (animal and vegetable food) and has a fuel value of
over 3000 calories. In all of these changes, the proportion
of rice was greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Probably, one of the chief reasons why persistent efforts
were made to improve the dietary of the navy was the prevalence
among the men of the disease known as beriberi.
“While no satisfactory explanation as to the cause of the
disease was offered, it was generally believed that there was
some very close relation between the disease and the rice
diet” (Oshima). During the years 1878–1883 inclusive, nearly
33 per cent of the marines suffered from beriberi. With the
adoption of the new ration in 1884, in which a large part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
of the rice was replaced by bread and other articles, and
with better hygienic conditions, this disease immediately
began to disappear, and during the six years after the adoption
of the new diet only 16 per cent of the marines were
affected by the disease. Later on, hardly more than two
or three cases a year were recorded. Advocates of a high
proteid diet bring forward this illustration as an evidence of
the danger connected with a lowered proteid intake; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
that the nutrition of the body will be impaired and diseases
of various sorts liable to follow. Yet, Oshima is very careful
to state, “It should be especially noted that here no attempt
has been made to indicate the cause of beriberi or the relation
between the disease and the diet.” That rice in itself can be
a cause of the disease is not to be considered for a moment.
Further, so far as any facts are concerned, the writer can see
no ground for considering that a low rate of proteid metabolism
has in itself any direct connection with the disease.
From a dietary standpoint, it seems far more plausible to
assume that the great restriction in variety of foods, so strikingly
manifest in the dietary of the poorer people of Japan,
results in a lack of some one or more elements which conduces
to the disease, just as in scurvy the lack of <i>fresh</i>
vegetables on long voyages was liable to be followed by an
epidemic of this disease.</p>

<p>Consider the natural character of the dietary of the great
bulk of the Japanese people, determined as it was by adverse
financial circumstances. As Oshima states, “The rural population
of the interior depends very largely or entirely upon a
vegetable diet. Fish is eaten perhaps once or twice a month,
and meat once or twice a year, if at all. The poorer working
classes in the cities also use very little animal food. But the
poorer classes in the city and the peasantry of the rural
districts comprise nearly 75 per cent of the total population,
and it is therefore safe to assume that this proportion lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
chiefly, or wholly, upon vegetable diet. And this, it may be
observed, means vegetarianism literally. The so-called lacto-vegetarianism
is unknown in Japan. Cows are scarce, and
milk and other dairy products are expensive, and such as
are available are consumed almost entirely by the wealthier
people in the cities.” It is also to be noted that the amount
of fat in Japanese dietaries is very small. The reported
data indicate that the usual vegetable dietaries contain only
about 10 grams of fat per day, while even in the average
mixed dietaries the amount rarely rises above 20 grams per
day. In other words, the ordinary food of the Japanese was
characterized by great lack of variety, and with such a preponderance
of carbohydrate materials of a limited kind that
it is easy to conceive of a possible dearth of some essential or
accessory element, necessary for the preservation of that nutritive
balance which aids in protection against disease.</p>

<p>If the resistance of the body to disease germs and toxic
influences in general is really diminished by reducing the
consumption of proteid food below the set dietary standards,
then obviously here lies a tangible reason for the maintenance
of a high proteid intake. I know of only one series
of scientific observations that bears directly on this question.
Dr. Reid Hunt of Washington has studied recently the power
of resistance to the poison acetonitrile of animals kept for
some time upon a reduced proteid diet. “My experiments,”
says Dr. Hunt, “showed in all cases that the resistance was
much increased.” In other words, the animals that had been
fed a low proteid ration were able to endure a much larger
dose of the poison than corresponding animals on their customary
diet; “they resisted 2–3 times the ordinary fatal dose
of acetonitrile.” This general subject, however, is obviously
a very important one, and merits further experimental study
under a diversity of conditions.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the facts here presented bearing on food requirements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
especially those that relate to the need for proteid
food, are seemingly harmonious in indicating that the physiological
necessities of the body are fully met by a much more
temperate use of food than is commonly practised. Dietary
standards based on the habits and usages of prosperous communities
are not in accord with the data furnished by exact
physiological experimentation. Nitrogen equilibrium can be
maintained on quantities of proteid food fully fifty per cent
less than the every-day habits of mankind imply to be necessary,
and this without increasing unduly the consumption of
non-nitrogenous food. A daily metabolism of proteid matter
equal to an exchange of 0.10–0.12 gram of nitrogen per kilogram
of body-weight is quite adequate for physiological
needs, provided a sufficient amount of non-nitrogenous foods&mdash;fats
and carbohydrates&mdash;is taken to meet the energy requirements
of the body.</p>

<p>The long-continued experiments on many individuals, representing
different types and degrees of activity, all agree
in indicating that equilibrium can be maintained indefinitely
on these smaller quantities of food, and that health and
strength can be equally well preserved, to say nothing of
possible improvement. The lifelong experience of individuals
and of communities affords sufficient corroborative evidence
that there is perfect safety in a closer adherence to
physiological needs in the nutrition of the body, and that these
needs, so far as proteid food is concerned, are in harmony with
the theory of an endogenous metabolism, or true tissue metabolism,
in which the necessary proteid exchange is exceedingly
limited in quantity. There are many suggestions of improvement
in bodily health, of greater efficiency in working power,
and of greater freedom from disease, in a system of dietetics
which aims to meet the physiological needs of the body without
undue waste of energy and unnecessary drain upon the
functions of digestion, absorption, excretion, and metabolism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
in general; a system which recognizes that the smooth running
of man’s bodily machinery calls for the exercise of reason
and intelligence, and is not to be intrusted solely to the
dictates of blind instinct or to the leadings of a capricious
appetite.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE EFFECT OF LOW PROTEID DIET ON HIGH
PROTEID ANIMALS</p>

on the alleged effects of low proteid diet on high proteid animals.

diet on the absorption and utilization of food materials in the intestine
of dogs. General conclusions from the results of experiments with
animals.</p>

<p>Man is by choice an omnivorous creature; he reaches
out ordinarily in all directions for as wide a variety
of foods as his circumstances and surroundings will allow. He
rightly cultivates a taste for foods that have individuality of
flavor, and derives pleasure and satisfaction from the eating
of delicacies that appeal to palate and to reason. All this he
can do without becoming an epicure or a glutton, and without
violation of physiological laws or disregard of the teachings of
temperance. As a being endowed with reason and intelligence
he is, however, necessarily mindful of the possible deleterious
effect of undue quantities of food, as he is likewise mindful of
the desirability of avoiding certain varieties of food which personal
experience has taught him are fraught with possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
danger. Care and prudence in diet are legitimate outcomes
of a reasonable interest in the welfare of the body, upon which
so largely depend the happiness and working power of the
individual.</p>

<p>The adoption of dietary habits that aim to accord with
the physiological requirements of the body does not compel a
crucifying of the flesh or a disregard of personal likes and dislikes.
A reasonable intelligence combined with a disposition to
exercise the same degree of judgment and care in the nutrition
of the body as is expended on other matters, of no greater importance,
pertaining to the individual, to the household, or to
business interests, are all that is needed to bring about harmony
between every-day dietary habits and the nutritive requirements
of the body. There is no occasion, unless one
finds pleasure and satisfaction in so doing, to resort to a limited
dietary of nuts and fruits, to become an ardent disciple of
vegetarianism, to adopt a cereal diet, to abjure meats entirely,
or to follow in an intensive fashion any particular dietary
hobby, except so far as may be necessary to insure an adequate
amount of non-nitrogenous foods to meet the energy
requirements of the body without unduly increasing the intake
of proteid or nitrogenous food. Naturally, a man leading
a life of great physical activity with the consequent demand
for a large energy-yielding intake will be compelled to resort
largely to vegetable foods, rich in starch and poor in proteid,
or to eat largely of fatty foods. Reliance on meats and animal
foods in general, under such conditions, would plainly
involve a high proteid intake with a consequent high nitrogen
metabolism, with the chance that even then the energy
requirement would not be fully met.</p>

<p>In view of all that has been said, reinforced by the various
facts brought forward as evidence, we must recognize the
value of the non-nitrogenous foods as a source of energy, and
this means plainly food from the plant kingdom. In any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
rational diet, vegetable foods of low nitrogen-content must
predominate, while animal foods with their higher nitrogen
values must be greatly subordinate in amount, if the nitrogen
or proteid metabolism of the body is to be maintained at a
level commensurate with true physiological requirements.
But there comes the ever-recurring question, Are the lower
proteid standards quite safe to follow? Are we warranted in
turning aside from the teachings based on the habits and
customs of mankind? Many reasons have already been presented
which seemingly justify an affirmative answer, while
the experimental results and the observations on various
groups of people, covering years of time, speak with no uncertainty
regarding the element of safety, and indicate clearly
that the absolute proteid requirement of the body is quite
small; much smaller indeed than the amount of proteid
food consumed by the average individual would seemingly
imply.</p>

<p>Probably the most striking evidence, certainly of an experimental
nature, so far presented against the safety of a relatively
low proteid diet for man is that based on the results of
several studies made to ascertain the effect of a reduced
proteid intake on so-called high proteid animals. Animal
kind may be divided into three groups according to the nature
of their food, viz., high proteid feeders, such as carnivorous
animals in general, of which the dog is a good type; omnivorous
or moderate proteid consumers, to which class man
belongs; and low proteid consumers, such as herbivorous
animals. Three series of experiments have been reported by
independent workers on the effects of reducing the amount of
proteid food in the diet of dogs. The results of these experiments
were of such a character that it has come to be understood
that animals of this type cannot exist for any great
length of time on a low proteid diet. It is affirmed that in a
relatively short period the animals reach such a state that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
they either die, or are in such poor condition that they must
be fed a more liberal amount of proteid to maintain them
alive. The explanation offered is that the low proteid diet
results “in a loss of the power of absorption from the intestinal
tract, caused apparently by a change in the condition of
the epithelial cells, as well as by a diminished secretion of the
digestive juices.”</p>

<p>The argument based on this evidence is that while a high
proteid animal feels at once, or almost immediately, the deleterious
effect of a reduction in the amount of proteid food,
an omnivorous animal may be more tardy in manifesting the
injurious action, which, however, is sure to follow sooner or
later from any material reduction of proteid below the customary
standards. In other words, man as a moderate proteid
consumer can endure for a time even large reductions in the
amount of proteid food, but eventually there will be manifested
some of the disastrous results obtained with dogs. Here, we
have a somewhat serious indictment, one that merits careful
consideration. To be sure, it may be objected that between
dog and man there is a wide gulf, and that there is no justification
for assuming that these two types of animal life have
anything in common. Still, the experience of many years
has taught the physiologist that much light can be thrown
upon the processes of higher types of life by a study of what
occurs in lower forms, and on the subject of nutrition any
one of experience would hesitate to cast out of court the
evidence gathered from observation of what occurs among
the higher animals. It will be the part of wisdom, therefore,
to scrutinize somewhat carefully the character of this evidence
obtained from a study of the behavior of dogs toward a low
proteid diet.</p>

<p>The first series of experiments was made in 1891 by the
late Immanuel Munk of Berlin, privat docent of physiology
at the University, followed by further experiments in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
1893<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span> Four dogs in all were studied. The diet made use of
was “fleischmehl” (dried meat ground to a powder), fat (suet),
and rice boiled together with water. We may refer briefly to
the details of one experiment. The dog weighed 10.4 kilograms,
and at first was given a daily diet composed of 85
grams of rice, 29 grams of fat, and 30 grams of the flesh
meal. This ration contained 30.3 grams of proteid, 31 grams
of fat, and 66 grams of carbohydrate, with a total fuel value
of 663 calories, or 63 calories per kilogram of body-weight.
On this diet, there was at the outset a slight loss of body-weight,
after which both body equilibrium and nitrogen equilibrium
were practically maintained. After this preliminary
period of three weeks, the day’s diet was altered by replacing
15 grams of the proteid by 15 grams of rice, so that the daily
ration consisted of 15.3 grams of proteid (with 2.42 grams of
nitrogen), 31 grams of fat, and 81 grams of carbohydrate,
with essentially the same fuel value per kilo of body-weight
as before. Later, the fuel value of the food was further
increased by raising the amount of rice to 125 grams per day,
the day’s ration then consisting of 15.5 grams of proteid, 37
grams of fat, and 96 grams of carbohydrate, with a total
fuel value of 780 physiological heat units, or 78 calories
per kilo. On this diet, nitrogen equilibrium was maintained
and the animal gained somewhat in body-weight. By the
seventh week, however, Munk reports that the animal began
to show signs of change; there was loss of appetite, absorption
of the daily food was impaired, both proteid and fat failing in
large degree to be utilized, while nitrogen equilibrium could
no longer be maintained. This condition continued during
the next week, aggravated by vomiting and accompanied by
loss of strength and vigor. At the beginning of the tenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
week of this low proteid ration, the animal was in a very poor
condition, with complete loss of appetite, little inclination to
take food, etc. On feeding a liberal diet of fresh meat, as
much as 250 grams per day, with some fat (50 grams a day),
the animal speedily recovered its appetite, and in a short
time was in normal condition, absorption of food and utilization
of the same being as complete as at the beginning of the
experiment.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give further details bearing on the
three additional experiments. It will suffice to quote the
general conclusions which Munk drew from the various results
obtained, viz., that a low proteid intake in the case of
dogs causes a loss of appetite, weakness, vomiting, etc., while
body-weight and nitrogen equilibrium are difficult or impossible
to maintain. More specifically, Munk’s observations led
him to state that for dogs of ten kilograms body-weight a daily
intake of 0.255 gram of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight is
not sufficient to maintain the normal condition of the body,
even when the fuel value of the day’s food amounts to more
than 100 calories per kilo. In order to have the animal continue
in nitrogen and body equilibrium, the daily food must
contain at least 0.31 gram of nitrogen per kilogram of body-weight,
with sufficient non-nitrogenous food to yield over
100 calories per kilo.</p>

<p>Let us now pass to the experiments made by Rosenheim<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span>
which were carried on at about the same date as Munk’s. In
the first experiment, the dog weighed 11.3 kilograms, and was
fed daily a low proteid ration having a fuel value of 1447
calories and containing 2.825 grams of nitrogen. This ration
was reduced in a short time to a still lower plane, viz., to 1066<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
calories and 2.525 grams of nitrogen daily. The food as then
given was composed of 170 grams of rice, 50 grams of fat, and
25 grams of chopped meat, on which the dog gained weight and
preserved nitrogen equilibrium. For six weeks, or thereabouts,
the animal maintained its normal condition, after
which it began to show symptoms of a general disturbance,
with lack of appetite and weakness accompanied by a condition
of icterus. Addition of meat extract to the diet to improve
the flavor was without any appreciable effect. During
the next two weeks, the condition of the animal steadily grew
worse, although the body-weight remained practically stationary
and nitrogen equilibrium was maintained. A week later,
the animal died in a condition of exhaustion, without having
manifested any symptoms of disturbed metabolism. There
was found a marked catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane
of the gastro-intestinal tract, with a fatty degeneration
or metamorphosis of the glandular apparatus, but nothing sufficiently
specific to account for the peculiar manner of death.</p>

<p>A second experiment with a dog of 5.8 kilograms, fed on
meat, fat, and rice, led to essentially the same results as the
preceding experiment. At the end of the first month, there
appeared indications that the animal was not well, loss of appetite
being marked, with disturbance of the stomach accompanied
by occasional vomiting. These symptoms disappeared
quickly when the animal was given for a few days large
quantities of meat. On returning to the original low proteid
diet, with its large content of rice, the symptoms gradually
reappeared. At the end of two months the animal had again
lost its appetite, and before the end of the fifth month the
subject was dead. Post-mortem examination showed especially
a strong fatty degeneration of the epithelial cells of the
mucous membrane of the stomach and intestine. Rosenheim
concludes that a diet poor in proteid is unhealthful for dogs,
and that a daily ration containing even 0.32 gram of nitrogen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
per kilogram of body-weight, and with a fuel value of 110
calories per kilo, is not sufficient to maintain the animal in a
condition of health.</p>

<p>The next series of experiments was made by <span class="nowrap">Jägerroos<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span> of
Finland. This investigator was evidently impressed by the
unfavorable and monotonous character of the diet made use
of by the preceding investigators, and sought to introduce a
little variety, recognizing also that with a carnivorous animal
it is difficult to reduce the proteid to a low level and maintain
the necessary fuel value, without introducing foodstuffs to
which the animal is wholly unaccustomed. In the first experiment,
the dog had a body-weight of 5.77 kilograms, and
at the beginning was fed daily 40 grams of meat and 100
grams of sugar, equal to 0.31 gram of nitrogen and 80 calories
per kilo of body-weight. The experiment continued for eight
months, sugar being replaced in part by butter, and occasionally
bread, fat, and wheat meal being used in proper amount
to yield the given nitrogen and fuel values. During the last
five months, the intake of nitrogen per day averaged 0.29
gram per kilo, with a fuel value amounting to 89 calories
daily per kilo of body-weight. During this period, the animal
maintained a plus nitrogen balance for a large part of the
time. The experiment was then continued for two months
longer, with a gradual diminution in the nitrogen of the food
and in the fuel value, the animal dying at the end of the tenth
month.</p>

<p>In a second experiment, the dog made use of weighed at
the beginning 11.97 kilograms. During the first five months,
the average intake of nitrogen amounted daily to 0.29 gram
per kilo, while the average fuel value of the food (meat, fat,
and sugar) was 76 calories per kilo daily. In the middle
of the seventh month the animal was quite ill, with poor appetite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
vomiting, etc. Body-weight began to fall off, and the
animal soon died. With both of these animals, the experiment
ended suddenly by a sharp and short illness.</p>

<p>Jägerroos, however, believed that both animals died from a
severe case of infection, and not as the result of the diminished
intake of proteid. This view was fully substantiated, in his
opinion, by the evidence furnished on bacteriological and morphological
examination. There was no pathological alteration
and no fatty degeneration in the intestinal epithelium; nothing
to indicate any connection between the lowered proteid intake
and the death of the animal. To be sure, the long-continued
diet poor in nitrogen might have diminished the power of resistance
of the body, but no proof of this is offered. There was
indicated merely a simple infection, as shown by the presence
of Streptococcus and Bacterium coli communis in the blood.
But, as Jägerroos states, one might well conceive of a lowered
power of resistance on the part of the body, due not to any
change in diet, but to the long-continued confinement in a
cage with the enforced inactivity and lack of freedom. It is
to be noted, furthermore, that here there was no sign of a
gradual and progressive weakening of the body, no indication
of any disturbance of the digestive tract with diminished
power of absorption of either fat or proteid. On the contrary,
there was a sudden and sharp attack of some infectious disease
by which the animals quickly succumbed. Jägerroos was of
the opinion that in the absence of this infection the animals
would have continued to live for a long period of time.</p>

<p>If a low proteid diet works so inimically on high proteid animals
as Munk and Rosenheim thought, it would naturally be
expected that the small proteid ration followed so long by
Jägerroos would have resulted in the appearance of marked
symptoms, at least a gradual and persistent falling off in
body-weight, inability to maintain nitrogen equilibrium, etc.;
but none of these things occurred. In Munk’s first experiment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
the animal was given no fresh meat whatever during
four weeks. Is it not quite possible that in the abrupt cutting
off of this wonted form of food a disturbance may have been
set up in the gastro-intestinal tract, which paved the way for
the more serious results that followed? Jägerroos used only
fresh, uncooked meat in his experiments, and laid great stress
upon the importance of not departing any more than was
necessary from the accustomed form of diet. The writer is
strongly of the opinion that sufficient stress has not been laid
upon this phase of the subject. A satisfactory diet for dog as
for man must meet ordinary hygienic requirements; it must
not only be sufficient in amount, but it must be easily digestible,
of accustomed flavor, appealing to eye, nostrils, and palate,
with reasonable variation occasionally and of moderate volume.
With due regard to these conditions, I believe with Jägerroos
that not much attention need be paid to the proportion of
nitrogen therein, for however small the amount it will be
found sufficient to meet the needs of the body.</p>

<p>These are the results, collectively, so frequently used to
point a moral for man: Beware of the possible danger of reducing
the consumption of proteid food below the commonly
accepted dietary standards! We must admit, however, that
there is a woeful lack of agreement in these results, and it is
difficult to prevent a shadow of doubt from creeping over us
as we try to depict for ourselves the way in which a low
proteid ration exerts its deleterious effect on dogs. I do not
believe that radical changes in diet, whether they involve increase
or decrease in total quantities, or in specific elements
of the diet, can be made suddenly without danger of some
disturbance of the gastro-intestinal tract or other parts of the
economy, either in dog or man. It is reasonable to believe
also that a high proteid feeder, like a dog, with his more limited
dietary, will be far more sensitive to great changes than
omnivorous man with his wider range of foodstuffs. Moreover,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
there is just as good ground for believing that in any
animal, excess of proteid is as dangerous as a low proteid diet.
Too great a disturbance in the nutritive balance, whether it
involves excess or reduction in the amount of a given foodstuff,
is liable to be attended with serious disturbance in any
sensitive organism.</p>

<p>In illustration of these statements, we have some recent
results obtained by Watson and <span class="nowrap">Hunter<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> upon the influence
of diet on growth and nutrition. These investigators find that
young rats&mdash;two and a half months old&mdash;when fed upon a
diet composed exclusively of horse-flesh, which is chiefly proteid
matter with some fat, succumb very quickly, for some
reason. Of fourteen young rats fed on this meat diet, six died
on the third day. On the morning of this day, as the authors
state, “the rats appeared to be in their usual health, but an hour
after feeding one of them was lying on its side apparently unconscious.
In a few minutes others were affected. They
appeared to be paralyzed, they felt cold to the touch, exhibited
symptoms of tetany, and speedily became unconscious. Six
succumbed within half-an-hour. Of the remainder, some
showed similar symptoms, although in less degree, and they
recovered when the diet was changed to bread and skim milk.”
After two days of the so-called normal diet, composed of bread
and skim milk, the remaining eight rats were again placed
on an exclusive meat diet. They appeared now to have
acquired a certain degree of immunity, for although they exhibited
symptoms of deranged nutrition, these were gradually
recovered from and they gained in weight. At the end of the
eighth month, five of the animals were still alive and in apparent
good health, but their growth was permanently stunted.
With an exclusive diet of ox-flesh, young rats were much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
more liable to thrive, although their growth was distinctly
retarded.</p>

<p>This difference in the behavior of the animals towards the
two forms of proteid food is to be attributed to the fact that
ox-flesh contains more fat than horse-flesh, and consequently
the diet with this form of meat was less exclusively proteid
in character. Further, there were some indications that horse-flesh
is less digestible than ox-flesh. Another fact, showing
the far-reaching effect of a distinctly unphysiological diet, is
the marked influence of pure meat food on the progeny.
Thus, of 93 rats born of meat-fed parents only 19 were alive
at the end of two months, while of 97 young born of bread
and milk-fed rats, 82 were alive and in apparent health at the
end of the same period.</p>

<p>As illustrating how foods that have, superficially at least,
approximately the same chemical composition may react differently
in the animal body we have the observations of Watson
on rats fed with porridge, made by boiling oatmeal with water
and skim milk, as contrasted with a diet of bread and skim
milk, the two diets having essentially the same composition.
Of fourteen young rats fed exclusively on porridge, all, with
the exception of two that were withdrawn, succumbed within
five months, while the bread and milk-fed animals thrived as
usual. Adult rats, however, can live for prolonged periods
and maintain their weight on a porridge diet. It is believed
that the difference in the behavior of young rats to these two
closely allied forms of diet, is due to a difference in the digestibility
of the food, the porridge being presumably less readily
digested by the young animals than bread. With the more
fully developed digestive powers of the adult animals, however,
this difference in availability practically disappears as a
potent factor in their nutrition. Finally, mention may be
made of the fact that a pure rice diet, notably deficient in
proteid, arrests the growth of young rats and leads to a fatal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
issue within three months, while adult rats placed on such a
diet lose weight rapidly and die in about the same time. All
of these facts bearing on the nutrition of animals quite remote
from man have significance as showing how any wide departure
from a physiological diet, for that particular species or type,
may lead to very undesirable results, and they warn us not to
be too hasty in drawing far-reaching conclusions and sweeping
deductions from a few experiments with a given species of
animal.</p>

<p>Recurring now to the experiments made with dogs, there
is certainly suggested an element of danger in a low proteid
diet, which, if the experiments are taken at their face value
and the conclusions derived therefrom applied to man, needs
careful consideration. Jägerroos plainly was not inclined
toward the belief that a low nitrogen intake was the cause
of the unfortunate results that attended his experiments.
Still, his animals did die from some cause, and thereby his
position was weakened. Munk and Rosenheim, on the other
hand, from their experiments were apparently convinced that
a low proteid intake was inimical to dogs, and it will be remembered
Rosenheim concluded that “a daily ration containing
even 0.32 gram of nitrogen per kilogram of body-weight,
and with a fuel value of 110 calories per kilo, is not sufficient
to maintain the animal in a condition of health.” If this is
really true, there is some ground for the arguments advanced
by critical writers regarding the general subject of nitrogen
requirements of man. The evidence and the arguments,
however, have always seemed to the present writer frail and
faulty; but recognizing the hold they have taken on physiologists
and the way they are usually applied to man, I have
attempted to test the matter experimentally under conditions
which would yield trustworthy and conclusive results.</p>

<p>The question how far results obtained with dogs can be
applied safely to man may be open to discussion, but we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
first be sure of our facts before arguments or conclusions of
any kind are warranted. It is to be remembered that dogs are
as sensitive in many ways as man, and no physiological experiment
covering a long period of time can be carried out
with any hope of success unless there is due regard for proper
hygienic conditions, some degree of variety in diet, and reasonable
opportunities for fresh air and occasional exercise. I
fancy that even the most vigorous and hardy man, if confined
for six consecutive months in a room just large enough to furnish
requisite air-space and to permit of extending his body at
full length, would find himself at the end of such a period in
a condition far from healthful, even though there were perfect
freedom of choice in diet. If, however, there were added to the
above conditions monotony in diet extending through many
months, there would be no occasion for surprise if the individual
lost appetite and strength, and showed signs of disturbance
of the gastro-intestinal tract.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if there is full appreciation of the possible
effect of monotony, in the ordinary dietary experiments on
dogs. Man quickly feels the effect; the sportsman camping
in the woods by brook or lake enjoys his first meal of speckled
trout and has no thought of ever becoming tired of such a
delicacy; but as trout cooked in various ways continue to be
placed before him three times a day, and with perhaps very
little else, he soon passes into a frame of mind where salt
pork would be a luxury, and where he would prefer to go
hungry rather than eat the delicacy, if indeed he has appetite
to eat anything. Is it strange that dogs confined in cages
barely large enough to permit of their turning around, and
fed day after day and month after month with exactly the
same amount of desiccated meat, fat, and rice, should show
signs and symptoms, if nothing worse, of disturbed nutrition?
It is necessary in experiments of this kind that the animals
be confined for given periods, at least, since otherwise it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
would be impossible to determine the extent of nitrogen
excretion and the rate of proteid katabolism, etc. It is
possible, however, to limit the time of close confinement to,
say, ten consecutive days, this to be followed by a like period
of comparative freedom, thus insuring opportunities for an
abundance of fresh air and exercise.</p>

<p>The experiments of which I wish to speak, and which had
for their object a study of the effect of low proteid diet on
dogs, as types of high proteid animals, were carried out at our
laboratory in the Sheffield Scientific School and were made
possible by liberal grants from the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, thus providing means for securing the requisite
number of chemical assistants. The experiments were conducted
on a somewhat large scale, over twenty dogs being
made use of, while many of the experiments extended through
a full year. The results in their entirety are not yet ready
for publication, but I am able to present in a general way observations
on six dogs, which will serve as an ample illustration
of what may be expected with high proteid animals when
living on a low proteid diet under healthful conditions. All
of the six dogs whose cases are here presented were fed on a
mixed diet, with some fresh meat each day; bread, cracker
dust, milk, lard, and rice being the other foods drawn upon to
complete the dietary. The animals were fed twice a day,
each meal being accurately weighed and of definite chemical
composition. A large, light, and airy room, kept scrupulously
clean, and in the winter time properly heated by steam,
served as their main abiding place. In this room were a
suitable number of smaller compartments, the walls of which
were composed of open lattice work (of iron), so as not to
interfere with light or air, and yet adequate to keep the dogs
apart. These compartments were not cages in the ordinary
sense, but were truly large and roomy. The entire floor
under the dogs was composed of metal, the joints all soldered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
the floor being sloped to a metal gutter in front so that all
the compartments could be flushed out each morning and
kept sweet and clean. In pleasant weather, immediately after
their first meal, the dogs were taken out of doors to a large
enclosure near by, where they were allowed perfect freedom
until about four o’clock, when they were taken in for their
second meal (between four and five o’clock in the afternoon).
The outdoor enclosure was inaccessible to every one except
the holder of the key, and the dogs while there were wholly
free from annoyance. Once every month, during a period of
ten consecutive days, each dog was confined in the metabolism
cage so as to admit of the collection of all excreta, in order
to make a determination of the nitrogen balance. Practically,
therefore, each dog was in close confinement only one-third of
the month, the remaining two-thirds being spent in much more
congenial surroundings. I have entered thus fully into a description
of the conditions prevailing, because I deem them exceedingly
important, and because therein undoubtedly lies the
explanation of the striking contrast between our results and
those of the earlier investigators of this subject.</p>

<p>In considering the outcome of our experiments, it may be
wise to enter into some detail concerning the first case to be
presented. The animal employed in this experiment was
designated as No. 5, and weighed on July 27, 1905, 17.2 kilograms;
it was apparently full grown, but was thin and had
the appearance of being underfed. At first, it was given daily
172 grams of meat, 124 grams of cracker dust, and 72 grams
of lard, the day’s ration containing 8.66 grams of nitrogen
and having a fuel value of 1389 calories<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> These figures are
equivalent to 80 calories, and 0.50 gram of nitrogen, per kilogram
of body-weight. The animal took kindly to the diet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
but on August 3 it refused to eat and seemed to have a
little fever. The next day it was better, but for the three
following days its appetite was poor, and only a portion of
the daily food was eaten. Body-weight began to fall off, and
was soon at 15.5 kilograms. On the 7th of August, a dose of
vermifuge was given, after which the appetite returned and
the animal appeared in good spirits. From this time forward
it seemed in perfect health, with good appetite, and showed
the usual vivacity and playfulness of dog-kind. The diet as
specified was continued unchanged until August 25, a balance
experiment covering a period of ten days, from the 15th to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
the 24th of August inclusive, being carried out, in which the
nitrogen of the intake was compared with the output for each
day. From the accompanying table, where are given the
average values of all the balance periods of the experiment,
it is to be seen that during this first period the animal was
laying on or gaining an average of 2 grams of nitrogen per
day.</p>

<p>On August 25, a radical change was made in the diet,
by reducing the amount of meat to 70 grams daily, thereby
lowering the intake of nitrogen to 4.76 grams, or 0.27 gram
per kilo of body-weight; the cracker dust and lard being kept
at essentially the same levels as before. This diet was continued
through the next balance period, the dog in the meantime
gaining in body-weight, and showing for the second
balance period an average gain by the body of half a gram of
nitrogen per day. The food was then altered by substituting
bread for the cracker dust, but so adjusted that the nitrogen
and fuel values of the day’s food remained practically unchanged.
There was still, however, a gain in body-weight
and a slight gain in body nitrogen. At the close of the third
balance period, the diet was again altered, one-half of the
meat being replaced by milk, while cracker dust was substituted
for the bread. The morning meal consisted of 170
grams of milk, 86 grams of cracker dust, and 18 grams of
lard, while the afternoon meal was composed of 35 grams of
meat, 63 grams of cracker, and 35 grams of lard. The day’s
ration, however, still contained 4.76 grams of nitrogen and
had a fuel value of 1249 calories. This diet was maintained
until November 20, when the animal was again placed on a
daily ration of meat (69 grams), bread (166 grams), and
lard (80 grams), with a total fuel value of 1228 calories and
4.77 grams of nitrogen. This was continued until December
2, the dog still showing a plus nitrogen balance, but with a
little loss in body-weight. On December 2, the diet was again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
changed by substituting milk for a portion of the meat, but
the nitrogen and fuel values were maintained at the same
level as before. After a week, December 9, the food was
modified as follows: the morning meal contained 170 grams
of milk, 110 grams of rice, and 11 grams of lard, while the
afternoon meal was composed of 35 grams of meat, 81 grams
of rice, and 30 grams of lard. The total nitrogen content
of the day’s ration was 4.07 grams, while the fuel value was
1255 calories. At this time, the animal weighed 17.1 kilograms,
consequently the intake of nitrogen had been reduced
to 0.23 gram per kilo of body-weight, while the fuel
value stood at 73 calories per kilogram. This diet was continued
until February 9, the balance period, between January 2
and 11, showing that the animal was in nitrogen equilibrium,
in spite of the material reduction in the intake of proteid, and
that body-weight was increasing. The next balance period,
January 30 to February 8, showed still further gain in weight
with continuance of nitrogen equilibrium. On February 9, the
diet was changed by returning to 70 grams of meat, 158 grams
of cracker dust, and 60 grams of lard, with a daily intake of
0.28 gram of nitrogen per kilo of body-weight.</p>

<p>In this manner, the experiment was continued with frequent
changes in the character of the diet, but always maintaining
essentially the same values in nitrogen and calories as shown
in the table, until June 27; having extended through just eleven
months, with the animal at the close of the experiment still
gaining in body-weight, with a steady plus balance of nitrogen,
and with every indication of good health and strength.
For ten months the animal lived with perfect comfort and in
good condition on an average daily intake of 0.26 gram of
nitrogen per kilogram of body-weight, and with an average
fuel value of 70.3 calories per kilo. Further, it is to be observed
that at no time during the ten months did the daily intake
of nitrogen rise above 0.28 gram per kilo, while during one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
month it fell to 0.23 gram per kilo. Similarly, the fuel value
of the daily food never exceeded 73 calories per kilo, while at
times it dropped as low as 67 and 65 calories per kilo. That
this diet was more than sufficient, both in nitrogen and fuel
value, is indicated by the steady increase in body-weight and
by the plus nitrogen balances observed in most of the periods
throughout the experiment. Indeed, with the comparatively
low degree of muscular activity which this animal was accustomed
to, it would have been unwise to have kept the subject
much longer on a diet so rich as the above, since there would
have been danger of detriment to its health and good condition.
When these results are contrasted with the statements
of Munk and Rosenheim, the latter of whom found that even
0.32 gram of nitrogen and 110 calories per kilo were insufficient
to maintain dogs in a condition of health, it is plain that for
some reason our results are quite at variance with their
findings.</p>

<p>The accompanying photographs, taken on August 19, 1905,
February 27, April 24, and at the close of the experiment on
June 27, 1906, show the appearance of the animal at the
respective dates, and indicate more clearly than words can
express the actual condition of the animal.</p>

<p>Turning now to a second subject, designated as dog No. 3,
the experiment with which lasted for nearly an entire year,
the following general statements may be made. The animal
was a small black and white fox terrier, weighing on July 6,
1905, 6.5 kilograms. It was a nervous, affectionate little
creature, far less phlegmatic than the animal just described,
always on the alert for a petting, and unceasingly active. For
these reasons, it seemingly required per kilogram of body-weight
a little more food than the preceding animal; a fact
also in harmony with the general law that small animals, per
unit of body-weight, need more food than larger ones. The
diet made use of was of the same general character as employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
with the preceding animal, and was changed from time
to time to give requisite variety and to insure freedom from
too great monotony. The accompanying table, showing daily
averages during the twelve balance periods, gives all necessary
information regarding the outcome of the experiment.</p>

<p>It will be observed that during the first three months the
animal showed a tendency to gain in weight slightly, recalling
that its initial weight on July 6 was 6.5 kilograms. Later,
the weight fell off a little, but in March it showed an upward
movement, though very gradual. With the amount of proteid
food given, it is evident that the animal needed about 80
calories per kilo to maintain a condition of body-equilibrium.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
Nitrogen equilibrium was practically maintained throughout
the larger portion of the twelve months, but evidently the
animal required 0.31–0.33 gram of nitrogen per kilogram of
body-weight. Attention may be directed, in view of the results
reported by Munk regarding loss of the power of absorption
and utilization of proteid food, to the figures showing
the average daily output of nitrogen through the excrement.
It is plain from the data presented, that this animal was not
suffering from any trouble of this order; indeed, the utilization
of proteid food throughout the entire experiment was
exceedingly complete, as shown by the relatively small loss of
nitrogen through the excrement, thus implying vigorous and
unimpaired digestion, together with thorough absorption of
the products formed.</p>

<p>The accompanying photographs show the appearance of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
animal on August 19, 1905, November 18, 1905, April 3 and

<p>Passing now to the third subject, we have an experiment of
somewhat shorter duration, viz., of nine months, but sufficiently
long to afford ample opportunity for any deleterious
effect to manifest itself. The initial weight of the dog,
No. 13, was 14.5 kilograms on September 14. The lowest
intake of nitrogen was 0.26 gram per kilo of body-weight per
day, while the fuel value of the daily food was during one
period reduced to 55 calories per kilo. A daily proteid consumption
equalling 0.30 gram of nitrogen per kilo, with a
total fuel value in the day’s food of 66–70 calories per kilo, was
clearly quite sufficient to maintain nitrogen equilibrium and
body-weight; indeed, toward the end of the experiment, the
animal commenced to gain in weight quite noticeably on the
above diet, and was laying by fairly large amounts of nitrogen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
daily. The accompanying table gives the average daily
nitrogen exchange, etc., of the nine balance periods, while the
photographs, taken on the dates indicated under each, show
the appearance of the animal at various times.</p>

<p>Results of the same general tenor with dogs No. 15 and
No. 20 are seen in the appended tables, while the accompanying
photographs testify clearly to the general good
condition of the animals up to the end of the experiments.
In No. 20 particularly, the great gain in body-weight is
to be noted, even though the fuel value of the food was
reduced as low as 64 calories per kilo, with the nitrogen intake
at 0.28 gram per kilo daily. Plainly, the day’s food could
have been diminished still more, with perfect safety to both
body and nitrogen equilibrium.</p>

The illustrations so far presented, with the general agreement
in the character of the results, might perhaps be interpreted
as indicating that there is no difficulty whatever in
bringing a high proteid consumer, like a dog, down to a low
level of proteid consumption.  This, however, would be a
false impression. Much depends upon the character of the
proteid food, at least where any attempt at rapid change is
made, for a certain modicum of meat or other animal food
seems a necessary part of the daily diet if health and strength
are to be maintained. A dog transferred suddenly from a
daily ration in which meat and milk are conspicuous elements
to a diet in which these are wholly wanting is very liable to
show disturbing symptoms almost immediately. One case
may be cited in illustration of these statements. On September
29, 1905, dog No. 17, weighing 18.2 kilos, was placed on
a daily diet composed of 70 grams of fresh meat, 442 grams
of milk, 300 grams of bread, and 28 grams of lard.  This
ration contained 9.06 grams of nitrogen and had a fuel value
of 1465 calories, or 0.5 gram of nitrogen and 80 calories per
kilogram of body-weight. On October 11, the animal weighed
18.6 kilograms and was in perfect condition. On the 13th, the
meat was reduced to 34 grams per day, but the milk was increased
in amount so as to maintain the same nitrogen intake
and fuel value as before.  This diet was continued until November
3, a balance experiment covering ten days from October
22 to the 31 inclusive, showing that the animal was laying
by a little nitrogen. On November 3, the diet was changed to
milk, bread, and lard, the fuel value being maintained at 80
calories per kilo daily, while the nitrogen intake was reduced
to 0.30 gram per kilo. On this diet, the animal seemed to
thrive perfectly, and at the end of two weeks showed a
body-weight of 18.2 kilograms.  November 19, the milk
was withdrawn, the bread being increased so as to keep the
daily nitrogen intake and the fuel value unchanged. The
day’s food was now composed of bread and lard solely, but, as
just stated, the nitrogen and fuel values were unaltered.  In
four days’ time, however, a change began to creep over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
animal; the appetite diminished, and there was apparent a
condition of lassitude and general weakness which deterred
the animal from moving about as usual.</p>

<p>During the next week the animal grew steadily worse, and
would eat only when coaxed with a little milk or with bread
softened with milk, the diet of bread and lard being invariably
refused. There was marked disturbance of the gastro-intestinal
tract; bloody discharges were frequent; the mucous
membrane of the mouth was greatly inflamed and very sore;
body-weight fell off, and the animal was in a very enfeebled
condition. This continued until December 4, with every indication
that the animal would not long survive, but by
feeding carefully with a little milk and occasionally some
meat, improvement finally manifested itself, and by December
18 there was good appetite, provided bread was not conspicuous
in the food. Body-weight, which had fallen to 15.5 kilos,
was being slowly regained, and on December 30 the animal
was again placed on a weighed diet, consisting of 70 grams of
meat, 442 grams of milk, 210 grams of cracker dust, and 10
grams of lard. This diet contained 8.26 grams of nitrogen
and had a fuel value of 1330 calories, equivalent to 0.5 gram
nitrogen and 80 calories per kilogram of body-weight. On
January 12, 1906, the weight of the animal was 16.7 kilos,
while in general condition there was nothing to be desired.
The food was then modified by diminishing the amounts of
meat and milk fed daily by one-half, thus reducing the nitrogen
intake to 0.35 gram per kilo of body-weight, but maintaining
the fuel value of the food at 80 calories per kilo. Under this
régime, body-weight still increased, and on January 27 was
17.5 kilograms. A balance period, shown in the accompanying
table, extending from January 30 to February 8, affords
ample evidence that the body was laying by nitrogen.</p>

<p>In all of the subsequent months, a small amount of meat
was a part of the daily food, but as is seen from the table of
balance periods, the total nitrogen intake and the fuel value
of the food were reduced to even lower levels per kilogram of
body-weight. Yet the animal gained steadily, until at the
latter part of June the weight was considerably above that
noted at the commencement of the experiment in the preceding
October. Further, the animal was in nitrogen equilibrium
or even gaining nitrogen, and in perfect condition of health
and vigor, as is indicated by the accompanying photographs
taken at the different periods stated. Especially to be emphasized
is the fact that during the last six months of the
experiment, the daily intake of nitrogen and the fuel value of
the food were as low or even lower than in November, when
the daily diet was limited to bread and lard. The disastrous
result which showed itself at once on this latter diet, with all
animal food excluded, was not due to low proteid or to deficiency
in fuel value, but simply to the fact that the animal for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
some reason could not adjust itself to a simple dietary of
bread and fat, although there was ample available nitrogen and
fuel value for the body’s needs. Something was lacking,
which meat or milk could supply, and this something was
indispensable for the maintenance of the normal nutritional
rhythm.</p>

<p>This is by no means an exceptional case, but we can cite
many other examples of like results where the animal when
restricted to a purely vegetable diet, such as bread, pea-soup,
bean soup, etc., reinforced by an animal fat, quickly passed
from a condition of health into a state of utter wretchedness,
with serious gastro-intestinal disturbance. The results are
not to be attributed to the lower utilization of the vegetable
food, for the disastrous effect is too quickly manifest, and
further, often shows itself when the animal plainly has a
large store of available nutriment in its own tissues.</p>

<p>This experiment with dog No. 17 has been dwelt upon at
some length, because it illustrates a very important principle
in the nutrition of a high proteid and carnivorous animal. As
before stated, it is not a question of high or low proteid simply,
but involves possibly the more subtle question of the relative
value of specific forms of proteid food. It will be noted that
this statement is made somewhat guardedly, in harmony with
the caution necessarily called for in view of our lack of
knowledge regarding the possible need of the animal’s body
for extraneous principles which only meat, milk, or other
animal products can supply. Inorganic salts, nitrogenous
extractives, and other substances without any appreciable fuel
value, are quite likely to be of primary importance in controlling
and regulating the various processes of the body, which
combine to maintain the condition of normal nutrition. With
a diet restricted to one or two vegetable products, it is quite
conceivable that something may be lacking which the system
demands, though it cannot be measured in terms of nitrogen
or calories. It may be said that man thrives on a purely
vegetable diet, but while this is unquestionably true, it must
be remembered that man with his free choice of food has recourse,
as a rule, to a large variety of vegetable products from
many sources, and consequently there is great likelihood of
his absorbing from these varied products such supplementary
matters as may be needed. On this question, we are in a
realm of doubt and uncertainty, but the possibilities suggested
must not be ignored, for they may contain a germ of truth of
the utmost importance. The fact remains, however, that a
dog when restricted to a purely vegetable dietary does not
thrive; a little animal food seems necessary to keep up health
and strength, and this suffices even though the daily nitrogen
intake and fuel value of the food are restricted to a level below
that of the vegetable dietary.</p>

<p>With these facts before us, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion
that some significance may attach to the specific nature
of the proteid. Of course, we must not overlook the radical
difference in dietary habits of man and dog. Man as an omnivorous
creature has for generations been accustomed to partake
largely of vegetable foods, and as a result his digestive
tract and his system as a whole has become acclimated, as it
were, to the nutritive effects of vegetable matter. Dogs, on
the other hand, are typical carnivores, and their habits for
generations have led in an opposite direction, so that their
gastro-intestinal tracts and their systems have become accustomed
to the effects of a diet in which animal food largely
predominates. Whether these deeply ingrained characteristics
are responsible in any large measure for the difference in
behavior of man, on a purely vegetable diet, and dogs is open
to question. It would certainly not be strange if such were
the case, but as we look at the facts collected in our study of
this subject, it is somewhat impressive to note how well dogs
thrive on a relatively large amount of vegetable food, provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
there is a modicum of animal food added thereto. In
other words, these high proteid consumers are apparently quite
able to utilize the vegetable foods, but there is something lacking
in such a dietary which the body has great need of. Is it
not quite possible, as already suggested, that the specific nature
of the proteid counts for something in nutrition? The
question cannot be answered definitely at present, but there
are certain facts slowly accumulating which make the question
a pertinent one in this connection.</p>

<p>Thus, it is becoming evident, as was pointed out in an
earlier chapter, that the many proteid substances occurring
in the animal and vegetable kingdoms are more or less unlike
each other in their chemical make-up. They yield different
decomposition products, or the same products in widely different
proportion, when broken down by the action of hydrolyzing
agents; and when we recall that the digestive enzymes of
the body convert the proteids of the food into these same
end-products, it is plain that in the assimilation and utilization
of the proteid foodstuffs the body has to deal with these
various chemical units. Hence, an animal suddenly restricted
to a dietary in which all of the proteid is furnished
by bread might be seriously incommoded, either by the excess
of certain amino-acids resulting therefrom, or by a lack of
certain other end-products to which its body is accustomed.
As an example, we may take the three typical proteids of the
wheat kernel, gliadin, glutenin, and leucosin, and note the
very striking difference in the proportion of certain of the
decomposition products of each, as reported by Osborne and
Clapp<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span></p>

<p>It is obvious from these figures that the three proteids of
the wheat kernel are radically different from each other.
Contrast, for example, the content of glutaminic acid in gliadin
with the amount in leucosin. With such striking differences
in chemical make-up, it is reasonable to assume that corresponding
differences in physiological action or food values may
exist. Further, “in respect to the amount of these amino-acids,
leucosin more nearly resembles the animal proteins than
the seed proteins thus far examined, and in this connection it
is interesting to note that leucosin occurs chiefly if not wholly
in the embryo of this seed and is probably one of its ‘tissue’
proteins, in contrast to the ‘reserve’ proteins of the endosperm
of which gliadin and glutenin form the chief part” (Osborne
and Clapp). In other words, animal proteids, such as those
of meat, are characterized like leucosin by a small content of
glutaminic acid and ammonia; while leucin, lysin, aspartic
acid, and arginin are relatively more abundant. Until we
know more on this subject, however, any broad generalization
would be out of place, but certainly there is justification for
the supposition that in these differences in chemical constitution
are to be found explanation of some of the peculiarities
common to certain varieties of proteid food. Wheat flour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
aside from its starch, is composed mainly of glutenin and
gliadin with their large content of glutaminic acid. Meat
proteids, on the other hand, like leucosin, contain only a
small fraction of this acid, and, with the other differences indicated,
meat proteid and wheat proteid as food for dogs or
other high proteid consumers may reasonably be expected to
have at the least very unequal values. And if we go a step
beyond this and suppose that in the formation of true tissue
proteid or the living protoplasm of the cell, certain of these
end-products of proteid decomposition are absolutely indispensable,
we can easily picture for ourselves a dearth of
such building stones in the long-continued use of a diet
which lacks that particular proteid from which the necessary
building stones can be split off in adequate number.</p>

<p>It has been said, notably by Munk, that in dogs fed for
some time on a low proteid diet there is a diminished power
of absorption from the intestinal tract, associated with
weakened digestion. If it is true that a lowered proteid intake
results in a diminished utilization of the ingested food,
that efficiency in the digestion and absorption of foodstuffs is
impaired, it can only be interpreted as meaning that some injurious
influence has been exerted on the epithelial cells of the
intestine or the adjacent gland cells. We have, however,
failed to find any evidence of deleterious action in the dogs that
we have experimented with, where due regard was paid to maintaining
a diet suitable for the physiological needs of the body.
In the experiments that we have cited, both nitrogen intake
and the fuel value of the food per day were lower than in
Munk’s experiments, but the utilization of fat and proteid
was not sensibly affected. The following tables give the results
with ten dogs (including the six dogs already described)
for lengths of time ranging from seven to twelve months, the
periods indicated being each of ten days’ duration and occurring
once each month. In the first table, the utilization of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
fat is shown, the figures given being based on determinations
of the amount of fat contained in the excrement.
Knowing the amount of fat in the daily food and the amount
which passed through the intestine, it is easy to calculate the
percentage of fat utilized.</p>

<p>It is perfectly plain from these results that there was no
falling off in the utilization of fat; the percentage amount
digested and absorbed, as in dogs 3 and 4, was just as large
at the end of the twelve months’ experiment as at the beginning.
Clearly, a so-called low nitrogen intake with dogs does
not lead to any loss of power in the utilization of the fat of
the food. This being so, it is equally clear that the arguments
based on Munk’s results in this direction, and applied
to man, are without adequate foundation.</p>

<p>The figures in the above table were obtained by determining
the amount of nitrogen in the dried excrement from the
animals, <i>i. e.</i> the amount that passed through the intestine unchanged<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span>
and knowing the content of nitrogen in the daily
food, the percentage of unabsorbed nitrogen was then easily
calculated, after which by simple subtraction the percentage
of utilized nitrogen was found. At first glance, it would
appear that as the experiments proceeded utilization of nitrogen
was less complete. In a sense, this was true, but it was
not connected with any impairment of the digestive or absorptive
powers of the intestine. It must be remembered that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
the earlier periods a larger proportion of the ingested nitrogen
was in the form of readily digestible meat, but as the latter
was reduced in amount larger proportions of vegetable food
were introduced in order to maintain the desired fuel value,
and consequently the percentage of non-absorbable nitrogen
was increased. The well-known difference in the availability
of animal and vegetable proteid has already been referred to
in other connections; a difference due not so much to any inherent
quality in the digestibility of the two forms of proteid as
to the presence of cellulose and other material in the vegetable
food which retards in some measure the action of the digestive
juices. To this cause must be ascribed the slight falling off
in the utilization of nitrogen noticeable in most of the experiments.
If, however, the figures are compared with those
usually obtained on a diet largely vegetable in nature, it will
be seen that the utilization of nitrogen by these dogs was in
no sense abnormal.</p>

<p>These experiments on the influence of a low proteid diet on
dogs, as a type of high proteid consumers, taken in their entirety,
afford convincing proof that such animals can live and
thrive on amounts of proteid and non-nitrogenous food far
below the standards set by Munk and Rosenheim. The deleterious
results reported by these investigators were not due
to the effects of low proteid or to diminished consumption of
non-nitrogenous foods, but are to be ascribed mainly to non-hygienic
conditions, or to a lack of care and physiological
good sense in the prescription of a narrow dietary not suited
to the habits and needs of this class of animals. Further, it is
obvious that the more or less broad deductions so frequently
drawn from the experiments of Munk and Rosenheim, especially
in their application to mankind, are entirely unwarranted
and without foundation in fact. Our experiments offer
satisfying proof that not only can dogs live on quantities of
proteid food per day smaller than these investigators deemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
necessary, and with a fuel value far below the standard adopted
by them; but, in addition, that these animals are quite able
on such a diet to gain in body-weight and to lay by nitrogen,
thereby indicating that even smaller quantities of food might
suffice to meet their true physiological requirements.</p>

<p>The results of these experiments with dogs, which we have
recorded in such detail, are in perfect harmony with the conclusions
arrived at by our experiments and observations with
man, and serve to strengthen the opinion, so many times expressed,
that the dietary habits of mankind and the dietary
standards based thereon are not always in accord with the true
physiological requirements of the body. If these views are
correct, and the facts presented seemingly indicate that they
are, it is time for enlightened people to give heed to such suggestions,
that their lives may be ordered more nearly in accord
with the best interests of the body. Physiological economy
in nutrition is not a myth, but a reality full of promise for the
welfare of the individual and of the community in general.
Ignorance on dietary matters should give place to an intelligent
comprehension of the body’s needs, and an adequate
understanding of how best to meet the legitimate demands of
the system for nourishment under given conditions of life. It
is said that more than half the earnings of the working people
of this country is spent for food. Here, we have suggested
another form of economy as worthy of consideration; less important
perhaps than that which relates to health and strength,
but still calling for thoughtful attention. We cannot afford to
be ignorant of these things; we must have definite knowledge
of the actual facts, and these can only be obtained by careful
research and investigation.</p>

<p>As a prominent writer on nutrition has well said, “The
health and strength of all are intimately dependent upon their
diet. Yet most people understand very little about what their
food contains, how it nourishes them, whether they are economical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
or wasteful in buying and preparing it for use, and
whether or not the food they eat is rightly fitted to the demands
of their bodies. The result of this ignorance is great
waste in the purchase and use of food, loss of money, and
injury to health” (Atwater). We all recognize the general
force and truth of this statement, but there is a surprising lack
of appreciation of the full significance of what is involved
thereby. If it is true that the demands of the body for proteid
food&mdash;which of all foods is the most expensive&mdash;are
fully met by an amount equal to one-half that ordinarily consumed,
and that health and strength are more satisfactorily
maintained thereby, it is easy to see how the acquisition of
dietary habits leading to consumption of food in harmony
with physiological needs will result in a fruitful twofold
economy; viz., economy in expenditure, and of still greater
moment, economy in the activities of the body by which food
and its waste products are cared for.</p>

<p>Knowledge has value in proportion to the benefit it
confers, directly or indirectly, on the human race.
Every new scientific fact or principle brought to light promises
help in the understanding of Nature’s laws, and when
rightly interpreted and properly applied is sure to aid in the
advancement and prosperity of the individual and of the
community. Proper methods of living, economical adjustment
of the intake to the varying needs of the body, avoidance
of excessive waste of foodstuffs and of energy, are all
desirable precepts, which rational people presumably are inclined
to follow so far as their knowledge and understanding
of the subject will permit. Here, as elsewhere, false teaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
may be exceedingly mischievous and lead to costly errors;
while blind reliance upon customs, instinct, and superstitions
is hardly in keeping with twentieth-century progress.</p>

<p>Modern scientific methods should give us help in dietetics,
as in other branches of hygiene and practical medicine. A
few short years ago, diphtheria was a scourge which brought
misery to many a home, for there was at hand no adequate
means of combating the disease; but scientific research has
given us new light, and placed at our command a weapon of
inestimable value. Do we hesitate to use it when the occasion
arises, because it happens to be out of keeping with old-time
customs and traditions? No, we recognize the possibility of
help, and as the need is urgent we turn to it quickly, with
hope and thankfulness that scientific progress has opened up
a pathway of escape from a threatened calamity.</p>

<p>Not many years ago we drank freely of such water as was
at hand, without realization of danger from bacteria or disease
germs, looking on epidemics of typhoid fever perhaps as a visitation
of Divine Providence, in punishment of our many sins
and to be borne meekly and with resignation. But all this
has changed through the researches of bacteriologists and
chemists; scientific facts of the utmost importance have been
clearly established; a classification of water-borne diseases has
been adopted, and we realize fully that diseases of this order
can be kept from our doors by proper precautions applied to
our water supply. To-day, epidemics of typhoid fever are
traceable solely to the ignorance or carelessness of the individual
or of the commonwealth, and the exemption which we of
the present generation have from this class of diseases is
directly due to the application of precautionary measures
based on the information furnished by scientific investigation.
It is proper for us to use caution in the acceptance of new ideas,
but not that form of caution which refuses change on the
ground that what has been is sufficiently good for the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
and the future. The point of view is ever changing with
advance of knowledge, and it is not profitable to exclude opportunities
for improvement in personal hygiene and general
good health, any more than in other matters that affect the
prosperity of the individual or the community.</p>

<p>Dietary habits should be brought into conformity with the
true needs of the body. Excessive consumption of proteid
food, especially, should be avoided on the ground that it is
not only unnecessary and wasteful, but is liable to bring
penalties of its own, most undesirable and wholly uncalled
for. We may, perhaps, accept these statements at their full
value, and yet have a shadow of doubt in our minds as to
whether, after all, dietary customs do not harmonize sufficiently
at least with true nutritive requirements. All the data that
we have presented in the preceding chapters, however, have
seemingly given a positive answer to such doubts, and indicate
quite clearly that the results of scientific study are opposed to
the prevailing dietary standards, especially as regards proteid
food. As the celebrated physiologist Bunge has expressed it,
“The necessity for a daily consumption of 100 grams of proteid
is incomprehensible, so long as we do not know of any
function of the body in the performance of which the chemical
potential energies of the destroyed proteid are used up.”</p>

<p>Perfectly trustworthy evidence is at hand showing that the
needs of the body for potential energy can be fully met, and
indeed are more advantageously met, by the non-nitrogenous
foods, carbohydrates and fats. The energy of muscle work,
as we have seen, comes preferably from the breaking down of
non-nitrogenous material, so that there is no special call for
proteid in connection with increased muscular activity. In
fact, it would appear that the need for proteid food by man is
limited to the requirements of growth and development, reinforced
by the amount called for in that form of tissue
exchange which we have emphasized under the term “endogenous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
proteid metabolism,” or true tissue metabolism.
To be sure, there must be a certain reserve of proteid, available
in case of emergency, but this is easily established without
resorting to excessive feeding.</p>

<p>The peculiar position which proteid foods occupy in man’s
dietary naturally make them the central figure, around which
the other foods are grouped. No other form of food can take
the place of proteid; a certain amount is needed each day to
make good the loss of tissue material broken down in endogenous
katabolism, and consequently our choice and combination
of the varied articles of diet made use of should be
regulated by the amount of proteid they contain. But while
proteid foods occupy this commanding position, it is not necessary
or desirable that they should exceed the other foodstuffs
in amount, or indeed approach them in quantity. We
must be ever mindful of the fact, so many times expressed,
that proteid does not undergo complete oxidation in the body
to simple gaseous products like the non-nitrogenous foods,
but that there is left behind a residue of non-combustible
matter&mdash;solid oxidation products&mdash;which are not so easily
disposed of. In the forceful language of another, “The combustion
of proteid within the organism yields a solid ash
which must be raked down by the liver and thrown out by
the kidneys. Now when this task gets to be over-laborious,
the laborers are likely to go on strike. The grate, then, is
not properly raked; clinkers form, and slowly the smothered
fire glows dull and dies” (Curtis).</p>

<p>Even though no such dire fate overtakes one, the penalties
of excessive proteid consumption are found in many ills, for
which perhaps the victim seeks in vain a logical explanation;
gastro-intestinal disturbance, indigestion, intestinal toxæmia,
liver troubles, bilious attacks, gout, rheumatism, to say nothing
of many other ailments, some more and some less serious, are
associated with the habitual overeating of proteid food. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
excessive food consumption is by no means confined to the
proteid foodstuffs; general overfeeding is a widespread evil,
the marks of which are to be detected on all sides, and in no
uncertain fashion. One of the most common signs of excessive
food consumption is the tendency toward obesity, a condition
which is distinctly undesirable and may prove decidedly
injurious. Undue accumulation of fat is not only a mechanical
obstacle to the proper activity of the body as a whole,
but it interferes with the freedom of movement of such
muscular organs as the heart and stomach, thereby interposing
obstacles to the normal action of these structures. Further,
whenever undue fat formation is going on in the body, there
is the ever present danger that the lifeless fat may replace
the living protoplasm of the tissue cells and so give rise to a
condition known as “fatty degeneration.” While a superabundance
of fat in the body is a sure telltale of overeating,
the absence of obesity is by no means an indication that excess
of food is being avoided. There is here, in man as in animal
kind, much idiosyncrasy; some persons, especially those endowed
with a long and large frame, tend to keep thin even
though they eat excessively, while others grow fat much
more readily. As a well-known physician has expressed it,
“In the one case, the subject burns, instantly and mercilessly,
every stick of fuel delivered at his door, whether or not he
needs the resulting hot fire roaring within, while the other,
miser-like, hoards the rest in vast piles, filling the house from
cellar to garret.”</p>

<p>Temperance in diet, like temperance in other matters, leads
to good results, and our physiological evidence points out
plainly, like a signpost all can read, that there is no demand
on the part of the body for such quantities of food as custom
and habit call for. Healthfulness and longevity are the prizes
awarded for the successful pursuance of a temperate life,
modelled in conformity with Nature’s laws. Intemperance, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
the other hand, in diet as in other matters, is equally liable
to be followed by disaster. A physician of many years’ experience,
with opportunities for observation among different
classes of people, has written, “that overeating tends to
shrink the span of life in proportion as it expands the liver is
demonstrable both directly and indirectly. Let any actuary
of life-insurance be asked his experience with heavy-weight
risks, where the waist measures more than the chest, and the
long-drawn face of the businessman, at memory of lost dollars,
will make answer without need of words. Then let be noted
the physique of the blessed ones that attain to green old age,
and, in nine cases out of ten, spry old boys&mdash;no disparagement,
but all honor in the phrase&mdash;will be found to be
modelled after the type of octogenarian Bryant or nonogenarian
Bancroft&mdash;the whitefaced, wiry, and spare, as contrasted
with the red-faced, the pursy, and the stout. It is
true, as has already been mentioned, that in old age much of
an adventitious obesity is absorbed and disappears, but the
Bryant-Bancroft type is that of a subject who never has been
fat at all. And just such is preëminently the type that rides
easily past the fourscore mark, reins well in hand, and good
for many another lap in the race of life.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span></p>

<p>With these thoughts before us, we may consider briefly
just what is involved in these new dietary standards that aim
to conform more closely with actual body needs. Referring
at first to proteid food, it may be wise to again emphasize the
fact that the weight of the body, <i>i. e.</i>, the weight of the proteid-containing
tissues, as contrasted with excessive fat accumulation,
is one of the important factors not to be overlooked
when determining the dietary needs of a given individual.
As must be perfectly clear, from all that has been said, the
man of 170 pounds’ body-weight has more proteid tissue to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
nourish than the man of 130 pounds’ weight, and consequently
what will satisfy the requirements of the latter individual will
not suffice for the former. We must understand distinctly
that no general statement can be made applicable to mankind
at large, but due consideration must be given to the size and
weight of the individual structure. We have found that the
average need for proteid food by adults is fully met by a daily
metabolism equal to an exchange of 0.12 gram of nitrogen
per kilogram of body-weight. This means a katabolism of
three-fourths of a gram of proteid matter daily, per kilogram.</p>

<p>Remembering, however, that the intake of proteid food must
be somewhat in excess of the actual proteid katabolism, since
not all of the proteid of the food is available, and as this is a
variable amount depending upon the proportion of animal and
vegetable foods with their different degrees of digestibility
and availability, we may place the required intake of proteid
at 0.85 gram per kilogram of body-weight, still keeping to
maximum figures for safety’s sake. Hence, for a man weighing
70 kilograms or 154 pounds, there would be required
daily 59.5 grams&mdash;say 60 grams&mdash;of proteid food to meet
the needs of the body. These are perfectly trustworthy
figures, with a reasonable margin of safety, and carrying perfect
assurance of being really more than sufficient to meet the
true wants of the body; adequate to supply all physiological
demands for reserve proteid, and able to cope with the erratic
requirements of personal idiosyncrasies. It will be observed
that such an intake of proteid food daily is equal to one-half
the Voit standard for a man of this weight, while it is still
further below the Atwater standard and far below the common
practices of the majority of mankind in Europe and America,
as indicated by the published dietary studies.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to state at this point that in the
writer’s opinion the use of the terms “standard diet” and
“dietary standards,” etc., is objectionable, since such usage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
seems to demand a certain degree of definiteness in the daily
diet for which there is no justification. As in the use of the
term “normal diet,” there is danger of misinterpretation, and
of the assumption that dietary habits should be regulated
strictly in accord with certain set principles. This I believe
to be altogether wrong; there should be, on the contrary, full
latitude for individual freedom, but freedom governed by an
intelligence that appreciates the significance of scientific fact
and is willing to mould custom and habit into accord with
them. What is needed to-day is not so much an acceptance
of the view that man requires daily 0.85 gram of proteid per
kilogram of body-weight, as a full appreciation of the general
principle, which our definite figures have helped to work out,
that the requirements of the body for proteid food are far
below the customary habits of mankind, and that there is both
economy and gain in various directions to be derived by following
the general precepts which this view leads to. In other
words, there is no advantage, but, on the contrary, much bother
and worriment, in attempting to follow out in practice the
details of our more or less exact physiological experiments.</p>

<p>The general teaching which they afford, however, can be
adopted and put in practice in our daily lives, without striving
to follow too closely the so-called standards which our
experiments have led to. Again, the sample dietaries adopted
in our experiments have no special virtue, aside from the
general principle they teach that simple foods are quite adequate
for the nourishment of the body, and that the amount
of nitrogen or proteid they contain was sufficient to meet the
demands of the particular individuals consuming it. Broadening
intelligence on matters of food composition is called for
on all sides, and as this is acquired together with due appreciation
of the relative nutritive values of proteid, fat, and carbohydrate,
there is placed at our command the power of
intelligent discrimination, with the ability to apply the principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
set forth in our own way, in harmony with personal
likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>To the majority of us, not very familiar with the percentage
composition of ordinary food materials, and unaccustomed to
the weighing of food in grams, the figures given from time to
time may have failed to convey a very definite impression regarding
the actual amounts of the various foods made use of.
Further, our ideas concerning the bulk of many of the common
articles of food necessary to furnish the 60 grams of proteid
required daily by a man of 70 kilograms body-weight
may be somewhat hazy. The following table, however, will
be of service in this direction:</p>

<p class="tac fs80 mb1em">*&nbsp;Fuel value of the quantity needed to furnish the sixty grams of proteid.</p>

<p>The figures in this table are instructive in many ways.
First, it is to be noted that the daily proteid requirement of
sixty grams can be obtained from one-half pound of lean meat
(uncooked), of which the loin steak is a type. Subject to some
variations in content of water, an equivalent weight of lean
flesh of any variety, lamb, veal, poultry, etc., will furnish
approximately the same amount of proteid. With fish, such
as halibut steak, and with liver, three-quarters of a pound are
required; while with sweetbreads, four-fifths of a pound are
needed to furnish the requisite amount of proteid. Of salt
codfish, one-half pound will provide the same amount of proteid
as an equivalent weight of fresh beef; while with lean
smoked bacon the amount rises to seven-eighths of a pound.
Among the vegetable products, it is to be observed that dried
peas and beans, almonds and pine nuts, are as rich in proteid
as the above-mentioned animal foods, essentially the same
weights being called for to provide the daily requirement of
proteid. The same is true of cheese, the variety designated
having such a composition that one-half pound is the equivalent,
so far as the content of proteid is concerned, of a like
amount of fresh beef. We must not be unmindful of the fact
previously mentioned, however, that there are differences in
digestibility among these various foodstuffs which tend to
lower somewhat the availability of the vegetable products,
also of the cheese, thereby necessitating a slight increase
in the amount of these foods required to equal the value to
the body of lean meat.</p>

<p>Secondly, passing to the other extreme in our list, we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
indicated types of foods exceedingly poor in proteid, such as
the fruits; notably, bananas, grapes, prunes, apples, etc., also
lettuce, and in less degree potatoes. These are the kinds of
food that may legitimately attract by their palatability, but do
not add materially to our intake of proteid even when consumed
in relatively large amounts. Thirdly, we see clearly
indicated a radical difference between the animal foods and
those of vegetable origin, in that with the former the fuel
value of the quantity necessary to furnish the sixty grams of
proteid is very small, as compared with a like amount of the
average vegetable product. One-half pound of lean meat, for
example, with its 60 grams of proteid, has a fuel value of
only 308 calories, while two-thirds of a pound of almonds
has a fuel value of 2020 calories, and one-half pound of dried
peas 827 calories. Naturally, this is mainly a question of
the proportion of fat or oil present. With fat meat, as in
bacon, the calorific value rises in proportion to increase in
the amount of fat, the proteid decreasing in greater or less
measure.</p>

<p>The main point to be emphasized in this connection, however,
is that a high proteid animal food, like lean meat, eggs,
fish, etc., obviously cannot alone serve as an advantageous
food for man. We see at once the philosophy of a mixed
diet. Let us assume that our average man of 70 kilograms
body-weight needs daily 2800 calories. On this assumption,
if he were to depend entirely upon lean beef for his sustenance,
he would require daily four and a half pounds of
such meat, which amount would furnish nine times the
quantity of proteid needed by his system. The same would
be more or less true of other kindred animal products. On
the other hand, certain vegetable foods on our list, such as
flaked rice, crackers, and shredded wheat, contain proteid,
with carbohydrate and fat, in such proportion that the energy
requirement would be met essentially by the same quantity as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
served to furnish the necessary proteid. Passing to the other
extreme among the vegetable products, as in potatoes and
bananas, for example, we find fuel value predominating largely
over proteid content. The ideal diet, however, is found in a
judicious admixture of foodstuffs of both animal and vegetable
origin. Wheat bread, reinforced by a little butter or fat
bacon to add to its calorific value, shredded wheat with rich
cream, crackers with cheese, bread and milk, eggs with bacon,
meat with potatoes, etc.; the common, every-day household
admixtures, provide combinations which can easily be made to
accord with true physiological requirements. The same may
be equally true of the more complicated dishes evolved by the
high art of modern cookery.</p>

<p>Lastly, our table throws light upon certain questions of
household economy. The cost of foods is regulated mainly
not by the value of the nutrients contained therein, but
by other factors of quite a different nature. Relationship
between supply and demand naturally counts here as in
other directions, but our demand is liable to be based not
upon food values, but rather upon delicacy of flavor, palatability,
and other kindred fancies, some real and some imaginary.
Ordinary crackers can be purchased for ten cents a
pound, but if we desire a little stronger flavor of salt and a
special box to hold them, we pay eighteen cents a pound.
Rolled very thin and thus made more delicate, they cost
twenty-five cents, while sold under a special name and perhaps
tied with a blue ribbon they cost thirty-five cents a pound.
Their nutritive value per pound is the same in all cases, but
we pay something for the increased labor of preparation and
a good deal for the added attractiveness to eye and palate.
We pay twenty-two cents a pound for round steak, thirty-two
cents for loin steak, and seventy-five cents a pound for sweetbreads,
the high price of the latter being regulated by the
relative scarcity of the article and not by its food value. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
our table indicates, the real value of sweetbread as a source of
proteid is only a little more than half that of lean beef. Its
fuel value, however, is somewhat more than that of beef, but
a little fat added to the latter will more than compensate and
at a trifling cost. When we can afford it, we pay the increased
price for sweetbreads simply because their delicacy and
flavor are attractive to us. We should not do it under the
mistaken idea that we are indulging in a highly nutritive
article of food, for as a matter of fact it is not only less nutritive
than a corresponding weight of lean beef, but in addition
it possesses certain qualities, in its high purin-content,
that are a menace to good health if indulged in too freely.</p>

<p>Where expense must be carefully guarded, or where the condition
of the family purse is such that conflicting demands
must be intelligently considered in order to insure wise expenditure
and the greatest permanent good of the many, it is
well to remember that price is no guarantee whatever of real
nutritive value. Two quarts of milk will furnish half the
daily fuel requirement of our average man and the entire
proteid requirement, while its cost is only sixteen cents.
Reinforced by a pound loaf of wheat bread, the energy requirement
for the day would be fully met, with surplus nitrogen
to store up for future needs, and at an additional cost
of only ten cents. A mixture in this proportion, however,
would not be strictly physiological, since it is wasteful of proteid,
but it may serve to illustrate the point. A better illustration
is found in an admixture, quite adequate to supply the
daily needs of our average man, both for proteid and energy,
composed of one-quarter of a pound of lean beef, two-thirds of
a pound of bread, and half a pound of butter, and at a total
cost not to exceed thirty cents. The contrast of such prices
with what is so commonly paid for table delicacies is somewhat
striking; it could be made still more so by drawing
upon many common vegetable foods, rich alike in proteid and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
in fuel value, the cost of which is even less than the simple
food mixtures just referred to. It is not necessary, however,
to enlarge upon this question; it is sufficient to merely emphasize
the fact that the exaggerated demand of our present
generation for dietetic luxuries is leading us far away from
the proverbially simple life of our forefathers, and without
adding in any way to the effectiveness of the daily diet. On
the contrary, it is in part responsible for the high proteid consumption
of the present day, with its attendant evils, and involves
a large and unnecessary expenditure without adequate
return. The wants of the body for food are far more advantageously
met by a simple dietary, moderate in amount and at
an expense comparatively slight.</p>

<p>A recent writer<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span> in the “British Medical Journal,” a
practitioner of medicine in the Highlands of Scotland, has
said that these are “facts of common experience in the Highlands
of Scotland, and probably among the peasantry of other
countries also, where the old beliefs and customs have not too
readily given way to the luxuries of civilization. Oatmeal in
one form or another is a daily ingredient in the diet of a
Highland peasant. The potato also is a staple food, and is
consumed in large quantities with salt herring or other fish,
and perhaps in some cases salt mutton or pork. Milk and
eggs are used by most. The growing consumption of tea,
however, and the increasing relish for sweets, candy, pastry,
and biscuits, threaten to destroy the old way of living. A
typical day’s diet for a crofter or fisherman who still believes
in the traditional diet would be somewhat like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Breakfast.&mdash;Oatmeal porridge or brose with milk; bread, butter, and tea.</p>
<p>Dinner.&mdash;Potatoes galore and herrings, or other salt fish.</p>
<p>Supper.&mdash;Porridge and milk, or oat bread and cheese, and tea.</p>
</div>

<p>“I have often been assured by shepherds that they could
work all day ‘on the hill’ after a breakfast of oatmeal brose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
and milk, without fatigue and without feeling hungry, returning
in the evening to partake of a dish of broth, potatoes, and
salt mutton. In these diets, proteid forms a very small proportion,
and yet a hardier race than these shepherds and fishermen
cannot be found.” It should be added that “brose”
consists of a few handfuls of oatmeal, to which is added boiling
water, the mixture being stirred vigorously and placed
for a few minutes near the fire. It is then eaten with milk,
or better, with cream. In the absence of positive data, it can
only be asserted that the above dietary stands for simplicity
and frugality. Its proteid-content may be low, but the
amount of proteid taken per day by these Highlanders will
obviously depend upon the <i>quantity</i> of food consumed. Oatmeal
is fairly rich in proteid, and it is quite conceivable that
the amount eaten daily may be such as to result in a high
proteid exchange.</p>

<p>It will be profitable for us to gain, if possible, a fairly clear
idea of the quantities of food requisite for our average man
of 70 kilograms body-weight; <i>i. e.</i>, the amounts necessary to
provide 60 grams of proteid and 2800 calories. With this
end in view, we may outline a simple dietary, expressed in
terms that will convey a clear impression, showing what may
be eaten without overstepping the required limits of proteid
or total calories:</p>

<p>The grand totals for the day, with this dietary, amount to
58.07 grams of proteid and 2729 calories. It is of course
understood that these figures are to be considered as only approximately
correct, but the illustration will suffice, perhaps, to
give a clearer understanding of the actual quantities of food
involved in a daily ration approaching the requirements for a
man of 70 kilograms body-weight. Further, there may be
suggested by the figures given for proteid and fuel value of
the different quantities of foods, a clearer conception of how
much given dietary articles count for in swelling the total
values of a day’s intake. Moreover, it is easy to see how the
diet can be added to or modified in a given direction. If a
little more proteid is desired without changing materially the
fuel value of the food a boiled egg can be added to the breakfast,
for example. An average-sized egg (of 53 grams) contains
6.9 grams of proteid, while it will increase the fuel value
of the food by only 80 calories. Or, if more vegetable proteid
is wished for, a soup of split-peas can be introduced, without
changing in any degree the calorific value of the diet. Thus,
one teacup of split-pea soup (144 grams) contains 8.64 grams
of proteid, while the fuel value of this quantity may be only
94 calories. The addition of one banana (160 grams) will
increase fuel value 153 calories, but will add only 2.28 grams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
of proteid. If it is desired to increase fuel value without
change in the proteid-content of the food, recourse can always
be had to butter, fat of meat, additional oil in salads, or to syrup
and sugar.</p>

<p>Such a menu as is roughly outlined, however, has perhaps
special value in emphasizing how largely the proteid intake
is increased by foods other than meats, and which are not
conspicuously rich in proteid matter. All wheat products,
for example, while abounding in starch, still show a large proportion
of proteid. Thus, shredded wheat biscuit (1 ounce),
which is a type of many kindred wheat preparations, from
bread and biscuit to the various so-called breakfast foods,
yields about 3 grams of proteid per ounce and approximately
100 calories. Even potato, which is conspicuously a carbohydrate
food owing to its large content of starch, yields of
nitrogen the equivalent of at least three-fourths of a gram of
proteid per ounce. If larger volume is desired without much
increase in real food value, there are always available green
foods, such as lettuce, celery, greens of various sorts, fruits,
such as apples, grapes, oranges, etc. Too great reliance on
meats as a type of concentrated food, on the other hand,
augments largely the intake of proteid, and adds a relatively
small amount to the fuel value of the day’s ration.</p>

<p>An ingenious method of indicating food values, which
promises to be of service in sanatoria and under other conditions
where it is desirable to record or correct the diet of a
large number of persons, has been devised recently by Professor
Fisher<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> The method aims to save labor, and is likewise
designed to visualize the magnitude and proportions of
the diet. The food is measured by calories instead of by
weight, a “standard portion” of 100 large calories being the
unit made use of. In carrying out the method, foods are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
served at table in “standard portions,” or multiples thereof.
In the words of Fisher, the amount of milk served, for
example, “instead of being a whole number of ounces,
should be 4.9 ounces&mdash;the amount that contains 100 calories.
This ‘standard portion’ constitutes about two-thirds of an
ordinary glass of milk. Of the 100 calories which it contains
19 will be in the form of proteid, 52 in fat, and 29 in
carbohydrate.” In the carrying out of this plan, it is evident
that the weight of any food yielding 100 calories becomes
a measure of the degree of concentration. From the standpoint
of fuel value, olive oil is probably one of the most
concentrated of foods, approximately one-third of an ounce
containing 100 calories. The following table, taken from
Fisher’s description of his method, will serve to show the
amounts of several foods constituting a “standard portion,”
and also the number of calories in the form of proteid, fat,
and carbohydrate:</p>

<p>Obviously, to make use of the “calories per cent” method
a table such as the above, covering all common foodstuffs and
showing the weight of each food constituting a standard portion,
together with the calories of proteid, fat, and carbohydrate
in this portion, is necessary. The chief advantage of
the method, however, is that it lends itself readily to geometrical
representation and affords an easy means of determining
the constituents of combinations of different foods by
use of a simple mechanism, for a description of which reference
must be made to the original paper.</p>

<p>Any attempt to follow a daily routine which accords with
the true needs of the body leads necessarily toward foods
derived from the plant kingdom, with the adoption of simple
dietary habits, and with greater freedom from the exciting influence
of the richer animal foods. There is, however, virtue
in a simple dietary that appeals and satisfies, and in so doing
testifies to the completeness with which it meets the physiological
requirements of the body. A physician<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> writing in
the “British Medical Journal,” says: “I determined to give the
minimum-of-proteid diet a fair trial in my own case. The result
was that I was relieved of a life-long tendency to acid
dyspepsia and occasional sick headache; my fitness for work,
my appetite and relish for food, were increased, without any
diminution, but rather a slight increase, in my weight. My
practice extends over a wide area of rough mountainous
country involving long journeys on cycle, on foot, driving,
and in open boats, in fair and foul weather. The muscular
exertion and endurance necessary for the work would seem to
require a large proportion of proteid and a generous diet altogether,
but since I began to experiment I have suffered less
than formerly from fatigue, and seem to eat in all a smaller
quantity of food. My diet consists of:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Breakfast, 8.30&nbsp;<span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;Oatmeal cakes, bread and butter, about 1 cubic inch of
cheese or bloater paste, marmalade, and one breakfast cup of tea.</p>

<p>Lunch, 1.30&nbsp;<span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;Same as breakfast, with occasionally a boiled egg, and
sometimes coffee instead of tea.</p>

<p>Dinner, 7&nbsp;<span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;Thick soup containing vegetables, with bread, followed by
suet pudding or fruit tart; or vegetable stew, containing 2 or 3 ounces of meat,
with boiled potatoes, followed by milk pudding and jam, and occasionally a
cup of black coffee.”</p>
</div>

<p>This statement of personal experience is in close accord
with statements that have come to the writer in hundreds of
letters during the past two or three years, from persons who
have for some reason chosen to follow a more abstemious
mode of life. Such testimony has a certain measure of value
in that it offers corroborative evidence of the beneficial effects
of a moderate diet, more closely in accord with the actual demands
of the body for food. It does not, however, carry quite
that degree of assurance that scientific evidence, gathered by
careful observers and controlled by weights and measures that
hold the imagination in check, affords; and so we may turn to a
different type of testimony, presented in an elaborate research
by Dr. Neumann<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> of the Hygienic Institute at Kiel, an experiment
on himself extending through a total of 746 days.</p>

<p>The experiment was divided into three periods. In the first
period of ten months the subject, with a body-weight of 66.5
kilograms, consumed daily on an average the amounts of food
indicated in the following table. In this same table are also
included the daily values, based on the preceding data, for a
body-weight of 70 kilograms. Thirdly, the table likewise
shows the amounts of utilizable food contained in the foodstuffs
actually eaten, on the basis of 70 kilos body-weight.</p>

<p>During this period of ten months, the body-weight of the
subject remained practically constant, or indeed showed a
slight gain up to 67 kilograms. All the functions of the
body, and the general condition of good health, were in no
wise impaired; so that in the words of the subject, the amount
of food eaten must have been sufficient for the needs of the
body. Somewhat striking is the fact that of the 2309 calories
in the daily food, more than one-fourth was derived from the
beer consumed daily (1200&nbsp;c.c.). Also noticeable is the relatively
small amount of carbohydrate taken daily, only about
one-half the quantity designated by Voit as the average requirement
of German laborers. Finally, it is to be observed
that during this period of ten months, the daily consumption
of food as calculated for a man of 70 kilograms body-weight,
based on the actual food consumption of the subject with a
weight of 66.5 kilos, was not widely different from our own
statement of 60 grams of proteid and 2800 calories. The
tendency, however, in Dr. Neumann’s experiment was toward
lower fuel values and somewhat higher proteid consumption.</p>

<p>In a second period of 50 days, with a slightly larger daily
intake, Dr. Neumann observed that his body was laying by
nitrogen, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, storing up proteid on a daily diet of 76.5 grams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
of proteid and with sufficient fat and carbohydrate to furnish
a total fuel value of 2658 calories. In the final period of 8
months, the following data were obtained:</p>

<p>During this period, it is to be noted that the fuel value of
the day’s food averaged only 2057 calories, which for a body-weight
of 70 kilograms would amount to less than 2000 calories.
The proteid consumption, however, was larger than we
have found to be necessary for a man of the above weight.
Still, the facts are in harmony with the general principle that
there is no necessity for a daily intake of food such as common
usage dictates, there being obviously a wide difference between
a minimal daily consumption of 118 grams of proteid and
3000 or more calories, such as is assumed to be needed by a
man of 70 kilos, and 74 grams of proteid with 1999 calories.
Under the latter conditions, the subject gained a kilogram in
weight during the eight months, while the establishment of
nitrogen equilibrium testifies to the now generally accepted
view that it is quite possible for the body to establish nitrogen
equilibrium at different levels, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, with different quantities
of proteid food and different fuel values.</p>

<p>The diet made use of by Neumann was a mixed one, containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
a great variety of animal and vegetable foods, but
withal simple and moderate in quantity. Calculated per kilogram
of body-weight, the average consumption of food material
per day during the three periods was as indicated in

<p>The average of daily food consumption for the total of 746
days was as follows: 74.2 grams proteid, 117 grams fat, 213
grams carbohydrate, and 2367 calories. On such a diet, during
this long period, equilibrium was satisfactorily maintained,
thereby furnishing additional evidence that quantities of food
way below the so-called normal amounts are quite adequate
to meet the needs of the body. There is no conflict whatever
between these results and our own; they both point in the
same general direction. Perhaps the one thing that needs to
be again emphasized, however, in view of the low fuel values
used by Neumann, is that while they proved quite adequate
in his case, the demand in this direction is governed largely
by the degree of bodily activity. In fact, Neumann’s results
with fuel values are in perfect harmony with the data obtained
by us with professional men, but the writer is inclined to
believe that for the majority of mankind, with the varying
degrees of activity and muscular exertion called for, a somewhat
larger number of heat units is desirable, and indeed on
many occasions demanded.</p>

<p>Still, it is perfectly obvious that custom has greatly exaggerated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
the fuel values required in ordinary muscular work,
and such results as are here presented tend to emphasize the
true relationship between actual requirements and fuel intake.
Further, it must not be overlooked that the rate of proteid
katabolism is governed in large measure by the amount of
non-nitrogenous food, and consequently a too narrow margin
in the consumption of the latter will obviously result in a
higher rate of proteid exchange. We are inclined to the
belief that a satisfactory degree of bodily efficiency is more
liable to be maintained with a somewhat larger consumption
of carbohydrate food, combined with a reduction in proteid
food to a level nearer our own figures. It will be observed
that the average amount of carbohydrate taken daily by
Neumann, during the 746 days, was only 213 grams, while the
daily consumption of fat averaged 117 grams. These figures
are interesting and instructive in many ways, especially as indicating
the ease with which the body accommodates itself to
a relatively low intake of proteid food, combined with a small
proportion of starches and sugars. This relationship between
carbohydrate and fat might well occur at times as a natural
result of personal taste, but as a general rule it is probably
better, from the standpoint of digestibility and general availability,
for the daily food to contain a larger proportion of
carbohydrate.</p>

<p>Under this head, I would lay special stress upon the value
to the body of the natural sugars as well as of starch. We
are inclined to deprecate the widespread use of candy, especially
among children, and there is no doubt that the too lavish use
of sugar in such concentrated form does at times do harm;
but when eaten as an integral part of the many available fruits
its use cannot be too highly lauded, for both young and old.
Oranges, grapes, prunes, dates, plums, and bananas are especially
to be commended, and in lesser degree peaches, apricots,
pears, apples, figs, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
In all of these fruits, it is the sugar especially that gives food
value to the article, while the mild acids and other extractives,
together with the water of the fruit, help in other ways
in the maintenance of good health. Where personal taste and
inclination are favorably disposed, the first six fruits named
can be partaken of freely, and the diet of the young, especially,
can be advantageously modified by the liberal use of such
articles of food.</p>

<p>Of the other fruits, apples when thoroughly ripe are
above reproach if properly masticated, but the raw fruit is
somewhat indigestible when swallowed in too large pieces, and
may cause trouble to a delicate stomach. A baked apple, on
the other hand, is both savory and wholesome, and if served
with sugar and cream, for example, constitutes a most healthful
and satisfying article of food. Peaches, apricots, and
strawberries as ripe fruits are likewise exceedingly valuable,
but here personal idiosyncrasy frequently comes to the fore,
especially with strawberries, and prohibits their free use.
The peculiar acidity of these latter fruits is occasionally a
source of trouble, which leads to their avoidance; but this is
far less liable to happen with people living on a low proteid
diet with its greater freedom from purin derivatives, or uric
acid antecedents. Further, there is a tendency on the part of
some individuals to suffer from acid fermentation with too
liberal use of starches and sugar, but as a rule the advantages
of ordinary starchy and natural sugar-containing foods cannot
be overestimated. It is certainly wise to give them a conspicuous
place in the daily dietary and to encourage their use,
especially by children.</p>

<p>As has been stated in several connections, a diet which
conforms to the true nutritive requirements of the body must
necessarily lead toward vegetable foods. In no other satisfactory
way can excess of proteid be avoided, and at the same
time the proper calorific value be obtained. This, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
does not mean vegetarianism, but simply a greater reliance
upon foods from the plant kingdom, with a corresponding diminution
in the typical animal foods. This raises the question
of the possible relation of diet to the bacterial processes of
the intestine, knowing, as we do, that the latter are of
primary importance in the causation of certain forms of auto-intoxication,
etc. Recent studies have indicated that the bacterial
flora of carnivorous animals is quite different from that
of herbivorous animals, and this being so, it is easy to see how
a predominance of vegetable or animal food may modify the
bacterial conditions of the intestinal tract in man. Dr.
<span class="nowrap">Herter<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> has reported the presence in the intestines of cats,
dogs, tigers, lion, and wolf of many spore-holding bacilli, as
well as free spores and vegetative forms of anærobic organisms;
some of which at least are decidedly pathogenic when
injected into the subcutaneous connective tissue, leading to
serious and even fatal results within twenty-four hours.
With herbivorous animals, on the other hand, such as the
buffalo, goat, horse, elephant, etc., the predominating organisms
are of a different order from those found in the intestines
of the carnivora; proving practically non-pathogenic,
or only slightly so, when injected subcutaneously, and less
disposed to produce putrefactive changes or other chemical
decompositions.</p>

<p>In the words of Dr. Herter, “These differences in the
appearance and behavior of the bacteria derived from typical
carnivora and herbivora suggest that the habit of living
upon a diet consisting exclusively of raw meat entails
differences in the types of bacteria that characterize the contents
of the large intestine. The occurrence of considerable
numbers of spore-bearing organisms in the carnivora points
to the presence of anærobic putrefactive forms in great numbers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
The results of subcutaneous inoculations into guinea-pigs
bear out this view and indicate that the numbers of
organisms capable of producing a hemorrhagic œdema with
tissue necrosis, with or without gas-production, are very considerable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The observations recorded are of much interest
in relation to the bacterial processes and nutrition of
herbivorous as distinguished from carnivorous animals, and
are significant furthermore for the interpretation of bacterial
conditions found in man. The question arises whether the
abundant use of meat over a long period of time may not
favor the development of much larger numbers of spore-bearing
putrefactive anærobes in the intestinal tract than
would be the case were a different type of proteid substituted
for meat.” While it may be said truly that observations of
this character are as yet not sufficiently numerous or conclusive
to warrant positive or sweeping statements, yet there is
a suggestion here well worthy of thoughtful consideration in
its general bearing on the nutrition of mankind.</p>

<p>Simplicity in diet, with or without complete abstinence
from meat, is often resorted to as a means of relief from bodily
ailments, and such cases sometimes afford striking illustrations
of the adequacy and benefits of a relatively low intake of food.
Cases of this sort, perhaps, are more frequently observed
among elderly people, where the daily requirements are not so
great as with younger and more active persons, but they offer
evidence in support of our main thesis that dietary habits are
no guarantee of bodily requirements. I have in mind the details
of an exceedingly interesting case reported with much
care by Dr. Fenger<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> the case of a man who at 61 years of
age, after a long period of poor health, brought himself
quickly into a condition of sound health by a daily diet characterized
by extreme simplicity and with an exceedingly low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
fuel value. The daily diet made use of during the fifteen
years the subject was under examination consisted of the
following articles:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pl3hi3">1889–1892: 1 egg, 1 quart of oatmeal soup, 2 quarts of skim milk, <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> ounces of

<p>It will be observed that during these fifteen years the subject
partook of no meat whatever, and further, that the diet
was wholly in fluid form. At the close of this long period,
the subject, being then 75 years of age, was reported as well
and in good health, with satisfactory physical condition for a
person of his years. He was a man of small body-weight,
only 42 kilograms, but during this period of voluntary restriction
in diet, he suffered no loss. It is perhaps worthy of
comment also that all through this lengthy period no salt was
taken other than what was naturally present in the simple
foods made use of. The point to attract our attention especially,
however, is that for fifteen years, during which the
quality and quantity of this man’s food was carefully observed,
body-weight, general good health, and physical vigor were all
maintained, together with freedom from the ills of previous
years and with a daily diet characterized by extreme simplicity.
The chemical composition of the diet was likewise peculiar,
particularly in its exceedingly low fuel value. The following
table shows the amounts of proteid, fat, and carbohydrate
consumed daily during the four periods designated:</p>

<p>Especially noticeable here is the low intake of fat and carbohydrate,
with the corresponding low fuel value, and also the
relatively high consumption of proteid, averaging 2.0 grams
daily per kilogram of body-weight. Dr. Fenger concludes
that for a man of this age and weight, with the relative inactivity
characteristic of old age, a heat value in the intake of 30
calories per kilogram of body-weight is quite sufficient for the
needs of the body. This may be quite true, but to maintain
nitrogen equilibrium under such conditions requires a larger
intake of proteid food than is desirable. It will be observed
that in the last period of four years a very decided change in
the diet was instituted; proteid was diminished somewhat,
but the noticeable change was the decided increase in fat, produced
in large measure by the substitution of whole milk,
with its contained cream, for skim milk. In the words of Dr.
Fenger, this change was necessitated by the appearance of
gout in the subject. From superficial examination of the dietary
of the preceding eleven years there would seem no occasion
for criticising the subject for high living, and yet I
believe we are quite within the limits of reason in saying that
the proteid exchange for a subject of this body-weight was
altogether too high. The heat requirements of the body were
being met in an unnecessarily large degree from the breaking
down of proteid material, with consequent formation of excessive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
nitrogenous waste, among which uric acid was plainly
conspicuous.</p>

<p>One comment to be made here is that meat and other rich
purin-containing foodstuffs are not the only source of gout
and uric acid. Excessive proteid katabolism, both exogenous
and endogenous, is a possible source of danger in this
respect, and the above subject, though living on an exceptionally
simple diet, was consuming far more proteid per
kilogram of body-weight than was necessary or desirable.
Increase of fatty food naturally served to diminish the rate of
proteid katabolism, and this could have been advantageously
accompanied by a still greater reduction in the amount of
proteid ingested, and a larger addition of non-nitrogenous
foodstuffs. In old age, there is naturally a slowing down of the
metabolic processes, and both nitrogen equilibrium and body
equilibrium can be satisfactorily maintained by a relatively
small intake of food and with gain to the body; but there is
every reason to believe that economy in proteid food can be
more advantageously adopted than economy in non-nitrogenous
foodstuffs.</p>

<p>Finally, we may call attention to the many possibilities of
an intelligent modification of the daily diet to the temporary
needs of the individual. The season of the year, summer and
winter, the climate, the degree of activity of the body, the
state of health, temporary ailments, etc., all present special
conditions which admit of particular dietetic treatment. In
hot summer weather, for example, there is plainly less need
for food than in the cold winter season, especially for fat with
its high calorific value. During the cold part of the year, the
lower temperature of the surrounding air, with the tendency
toward greater muscular activity, calls for more extensive
chemical decomposition in order to meet the demand for
heat, and the energy of muscular contraction. There is perhaps
no special reason for any material change in the amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
of proteid food consumed in the two seasons, except in so far
as it may seem desirable at times to take advantage of the
well-known stimulating properties of proteid to whip up
the general metabolism of the body, in harmony with the
principle that all metabolic processes may need spurring to
meet the demands of a greatly lowered temperature in the
surrounding air.</p>

<p>Fuel value, however, should be increased somewhat during
the winter months in our climate. Fat promises the largest
amount of energy, but there is more of a tendency to
store up excess of fat than of carbohydrate, hence the latter
foods have certain advantages as a source of the additional
energy needed during cold weather. In warm weather, it
should be our aim to diminish unnecessary heat production as
much as possible, though it must be remembered that the
body is to be maintained approximately at least in equilibrium,
and this calls for an adequate amount of food. Lighter foods,
however, may be advantageously employed, such as fruits,
vegetables, fresh fish, etc. Fats and fat meats especially are
to be avoided, not only because there is no specific need for
them, but particularly on account of a greater sensitiveness of
the gastro-intestinal tract during the hot seasons of the year,
that is liable to result in a disturbance whenever undue quantity
of rich or heavy food is taken. Further, in hot summer
weather we may advantageously live more largely on foods
served cold, and thereby avoid the heat ordinarily introduced
into the body by hot fluids and solids. These, however, are
all obvious physiological truths, constituting a form of physiological
good sense the application of which calls for no special
expert knowledge.</p>

<p>Less obvious, though no less important, is the partial protection
that can be afforded to weakened or disabled kidneys
by judgment and discrimination in the matter of diet. In
acute or chronic nephritis, forms of so-called Bright’s disease,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
is there not danger of overtaxing organs already weakened by
placing upon them the daily duty of excreting large amounts
of solid nitrogenous waste, as well as of the various inorganic
salts which are so intimately associated with many of the
organic foodstuffs? The consumption of excessive and unnecessary
amounts of proteid food simply means the ultimate
formation of just so much more urea, uric acid, etc., which
must be passed out through the kidneys. In the words of
Bunge, “There is no organ in our body so mercilessly ill
treated as the kidneys. The stomach reacts against overloading.
The kidneys are obliged to let everything pass through
them, and the harm done to them is not felt till it is too late
to avoid the evil consequences.” It would seem the part of
wisdom, therefore, to adjust the daily intake of proteid food to
as low a level as is consistent with the true needs of the body,
in those cases where the kidneys are at all enfeebled, or where
it seems desirable to exercise due precaution as a possible
means of prevention.</p>

<p>Equal care is frequently called for in connection with the
mineral matters which enter so largely into many natural
foodstuffs, or which are introduced as condiments. As an
illustration, we may note one or two peculiarities in the distribution
of sodium and potassium salts in the tissues of the
body. Potassium is an indispensable constituent of every living
cell, and the latter has the power of absorbing and holding
on to such amounts of this particular element as may be necessary
for the functional activity of the tissue of which it is
a part. Sodium, on the other hand, stands in a different
relationship to living structures. It is widely distributed,
but in the higher animals, as in man, sodium salts are most
abundant in the fluids of the body, notably in the plasma
of the blood. Herbivorous animals have a strong liking
for sodium chloride or common salt, but this is not true of
carnivorous animals; indeed, the latter animals have a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
dislike for salty articles of food. Vegetable products are
all rich in potassium salts, whereas ordinary animal foods,
such as meat, eggs, milk, and blood, are relatively poor in this
element.</p>

<p>It is claimed that the abundance of potassium salts in
vegetable foods is the cause of the apparent need for sodium
chloride by herbivorous animals, and in lesser degree by
man. This is explained by supposing that when the salts of
potassium reach the blood by absorption of the vegetable
foods, an interchange takes place with the sodium chloride of
the blood plasma. “Chloride of potassium and the sodium
salt of the acid which was combined with the potassium are
formed. Instead of the chloride of sodium, therefore, the
blood now contains another sodium salt, which did not form
part of the normal composition of the blood, or at any rate
not in so large a proportion. A foreign constituent or an
excess of a normal constituent, <i>i. e.</i>, sodium carbonate, has
arisen in the blood. But the kidneys possess the function of
maintaining the same composition of the blood, and of thus
eliminating every abnormal constituent and any excess of a
normal constituent. The sodium salt formed is therefore
ejected by the kidneys, together with the chloride of potassium,
and the blood becomes poorer in chlorine and sodium.
Common salt is therefore withdrawn from the organism by
the ingestion of potassium salts. This loss can only be made
up from without, and this explains the fact that animals which
live on a diet rich in potassium, have a longing for salt”
(Bunge). It is certainly a fact worthy of note that man takes
only one salt as such in addition to those that are naturally
present in his food, and it is equally significant that sodium
chloride is by no means lacking in ordinary foodstuffs. If
the individual lives entirely on animal foods, he has no desire
for salt, but as soon as he adopts a vegetable diet the craving
for salt shows itself. Vegetable foods, however, are not all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
alike in their content of potassium salts; some, like rice,
contain relatively little, while others, like potatoes, peas, and
beans, are comparatively rich in this element.</p>

<p>We may recognize in these statements a physiological demand
for a certain amount of salt, especially when vegetable
foods enter into the daily dietary, but there is no justification
for the employment of such quantities as are generally made
use of. Where the vegetable food is largely rice, a small
fraction of a gram of salt is really sufficient for all physiological
purposes; and in those cases where ordinary cereals, legumes,
potatoes, etc., constitute the chief part of the dietary,
a few grams of salt, at the most, will suffice to meet the daily
needs. Common usage, however, frequently raises the amount
consumed to 25 grams or more per day, the bulk of which is at
once eliminated through the kidneys; thereby entailing a certain
amount of renal activity, which must, it would seem,
constitute something of a strain upon organs ordinarily hard
worked at the best. “Do we not impose too great a task
upon them, and may it not be fraught with serious consequences?
When on a diet of meat and bread, without salt,
we excrete not more than from 6 to 8 grams of alkaline salts
in twenty-four hours. With a diet of potatoes, and a corresponding
addition of salt, over 100 grams of alkaline salts pass
through the kidneys in the day. May not there be danger
in this? The habit of drinking spirituous liquors, which
moreover is reckoned one of the causes of chronic nephritis,
also brings about the immoderate use of salt, and thus one
sin against nature leads to another” (Bunge).</p>

<p>The moral we would draw (from these observations) is that
in weakened conditions of the kidneys there is reason in reducing
the rate of proteid exchange to the lowest level consistent
with the maintenance of equilibrium and the preservation
of strength and vigor, thereby diminishing the amount of nitrogenous
waste to be eliminated and the consequent strain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
upon these organs. Further, there is suggested moderation
in the amount of salt to be used daily, and some circumspection
in the amount and quality of vegetable foods consumed
in order to regulate more effectually the quantity of saline
waste to be handled by the kidneys. These conclusions are
just as worthy of consideration as the more obvious rule that
in diabetes or glycosuria proper precaution must be observed
in the eating of carbohydrate foods. In gout and rheumatism,
accumulated physiological knowledge teaches plainly the
necessity of avoiding those foods that are rich in purin-containing
compounds. Uric acid owes its origin in part at
least to substances of this class; and as an ounce of prevention
is worth more than a pound of cure, we may by proper moderation
in the use of such foods save ourselves from the disagreeable
effects of accumulated uric acid deposits.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the nutrition of man, if it is to be carried
out by the individual in a manner adapted to obtaining the
best results, involves an intelligent appreciation of the needs
of the body under different conditions of life, and a willingness
to accept and put in practice the principles that scientific
research has brought to light, even though such principles
stand opposed to old-time traditions and customs. The master
words which promise help in the carrying out of an intelligent
plan of living are moderation and simplicity; moderation in
the amount of food consumed daily, simplicity in the character
of the dietary, in harmony with the old saying that man <i>eats
to live</i> and not lives to eat. In so doing there is promise of
health, strength, and longevity, with increased efficiency, as
the reward of obedience to Nature’s laws.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
